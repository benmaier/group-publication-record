      "abstract": "Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent objects like art, collectible, and in-game items. They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show \u2026"

Despite its increasing relevance in the financial world, a comprehensive analysis of the whole system is still lacking, as most studies have focused exclusively on the behaviour of one (Bitcoin) or few cryptocurrencies. Here, we consider the history of the entire market and analyse the behaviour of 1469 cryptocurrencies introduced between April 2013 and May 2017. We reveal that, while new cryptocurrencies appear and disappear continuously and their market capitalization is increasing (super-)exponentially, several statistical properties of the market have been stable for years. These include the number of active cryptocurrencies, market share distribution and the turnover of cryptocurrencies. Adopting an ecological perspective, we show that the so-called neutral model of evolution is \u2026"

Our results show that nontrivial, but ultimately simple, algorithmic mechanisms can help anticipate the short-term evolution of the cryptocurrency market."

A concurrent study has emphasized the explorative nature of human behaviour, showing that the number of visited places grows steadily over time\u2013. How to reconcile these seemingly contradicting facts remains an open question. Here, we analyse high-resolution multi-year traces of ~40,000 individuals from 4 datasets and show that this tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility patterns is considered. We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly yet smoothly, and that the number of familiar locations an individual visits at any point is a conserved quantity with a typical size of ~25. We use this finding to improve state-of-the-art modelling of human mobility,. Furthermore, shifting the attention from aggregated quantities to individual behaviour, we show that the size \u2026"

On the one hand, a highly influential body of literature on human mobility driven by analyses of massive empirical datasets finds that human movements show no evidence of characteristic spatial scales. There, human mobility is described as scale free\u2013. On the other hand, geographically, the concept of scale\u2014referring to meaningful levels of description from individual buildings to neighbourhoods, cities, regions and countries\u2014is central for the description of various aspects of human behaviour, such as socioeconomic interactions, or political and cultural dynamics,. Here we resolve this apparent paradox by showing that day-to-day human mobility does indeed contain meaningful scales, corresponding to spatial \u2018containers\u2019 that restrict mobility behaviour. The scale-free results arise from aggregating \u2026"

We show that the distributions of distances and waiting times between consecutive locations are best described by log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and that natural time-scales emerge from the regularity of human mobility. We point out that log-normal distributions also characterise the patterns of discovery of new places, implying that they are not a simple consequence of the routine of modern life."

In social networks, the propensity of nodes to engage in social interactions (activity) and their chances to be selected by active nodes (attractiveness) are heterogeneously distributed. Here, we present a time-varying network model where each node and the dynamical formation of ties are characterized by these two features. We study how these properties affect random-walk processes unfolding on the network when the time scales describing the process and the network evolution are comparable. We derive analytical solutions for the stationary state and the mean first-passage time of the process, and we study cases informed by empirical observations of social networks. Our work shows that previously disregarded properties of real social systems, such as heterogeneous distributions of activity and attractiveness as well as the correlations between them \u2026"

      "abstract": "The production and consumption of information on Bitcoin and other digital-, or crypto-, currencies have grown, along with their market capitalization. However, a systematic investigation of the relationship between online attention and market dynamics across multiple digital currencies is still lacking. Here, we quantify the interplay between the attention to digital currencies in Wikipedia and their market performance. We consider the entire edit history of currency-related pages and their views history from July 2015. First, we quantify the evolution of cryptocurrency presence in Wikipedia by analyzing the editorial activity and the network of co-edited pages. We found that a small community of tightly connected editors are responsible for most of the production of information about cryptocurrencies in Wikipedia. Then, we show that a simple trading strategy informed by Wikipedia views, performs better than baseline strategies, in terms of returns on investment, for most of the covered period, although the \u201cbuy and hold strategy\u201d dominates during the periods of explosive market expansion. Our results contribute to the recent literature on the interplay between online information and investment markets, and we anticipate that it will be of interest for researchers as well as investors."

This is the case of the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture describing the rational points on an elliptic curve, one of the most celebrated unsolved problems in mathematics. Here we extend the original empirical approach, to the analysis of the Cremona database of quantities relevant to BSD, inspecting more than 2.5 million elliptic curves by means of the latest techniques in data science, machine-learning and topological data analysis. Key quantities such as rank, Weierstrass coefficients, period, conductor, Tamagawa number, regulator and order of the Tate-Shafarevich group give rise to a high-dimensional point-cloud whose statistical properties we investigate. We reveal patterns and distributions in the rank versus Weierstrass coefficients, as well as the Beta distribution of the BSD ratio of the quantities. Via gradient boosted trees, machine learning is applied in finding inter-correlation amongst the various quantities. We anticipate that our approach will spark further research on the statistical properties of large datasets in Number Theory and more in general in pure Mathematics."

Here, we address this issue by using factorization techniques to decompose the temporal network describing mobility flows throughout 2020 into interpretable components. Our results are based on two mobility datasets: the first is gathered from Danish mobile network operators; the second originates from the Facebook Data-For-Good project. We find that mobility patterns can be described as the aggregation of three mobility network components roughly corresponding to travel during workdays, weekends and holidays, respectively.

Such an effective collective action was unprecedented in finance, and its dynamics remain unclear. Here, we analyse Reddit and financial data and rationalize the events based on recent findings describing how a small fraction of committed individuals may trigger behavioural cascades. First, we operationalize the concept of individual commitment in financial discussions. Second, we show that the increase of commitment within Reddit pre-dated the initial surge in price. Third, we reveal that initial committed users occupied a central position in the network of Reddit conversations. Finally, we show that the social identity of the broader Reddit community grew as the collective action unfolded. These findings \u2026"

      "abstract": "Data-driven research in mobility has prospered in recent years, providing solutions to real-world challenges including forecasting epidemics and planning transportation. These advancements were facilitated by computational tools enabling the analysis of large-scale data-sets of digital traces. One of the challenges when pre-processing spatial trajectories is the so-called stop location detection, that entails the reduction of raw time series to sequences of destinations where an individual was stationary. The most widely adopted solution to this problem was proposed by Hariharan and Toyama (2004) and involves filtering out non-stationary measurements, then applying agglomerative clustering on the stationary points. This state-of-the-art solution, however, suffers of two limitations: (i) frequently visited places located very close (such as adjacent buildings) are likely to be merged into a unique location, due to inherent measurement noise, (ii) traces for multiple users can not be analysed simultaneously, thus the definition of destination is not shared across users. In this paper, we describe the Infostop algorithm that overcomes the limitations of the state-of-the-art solution by leveraging the flow-based network community detection algorithm Infomap. We test Infostop for a population of  individuals with highly overlapping mobility. We show that the size of locations detected by Infostop saturates for increasing number of users and that time complexity grows slower than for previous solutions. We demonstrate that Infostop can be used to easily infer social meetings. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of Infostop, written in Python \u2026"

We review modelling approaches and observational evidence in multimodal mobility and public transport system dynamics, focusing on integrated real-world mobility patterns, where individuals navigate urban systems using different transport modes. We then provide a survey of freely available datasets on multimodal infrastructure and mobility, and a list of open source tools for their analyses. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on open research questions and promising directions for future research."

      "abstract": "Understanding human mobility can help creating solutions to society-wide issues, from urban planning and traffic forecasting, to the modelling of epidemics. Existing studies have shown that knowledge on how single individuals take spatial decisions is fundamental for modelling collective mobility patterns. However, individual mobility remains poorly understood, also due to the lack of suitable data. In this thesis, we use novel datasets to characterize and model mobility in relation to other individual aspects: social behaviour, personality, and demographic attributes. Our study focuses on mobility across unprecedented spatial ranges, from ~ 10 m to ~ 10000 Km, and temporal scales, from seconds to years."

      "abstract": "Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the dramatic and unsteady evolution of the cryptocurrency market has also been driven by large investments by traditional and cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds. Notwithstanding their critical role, our understanding of the relationship between institutional investments and the evolution of the cryptocurrency market has remained limited, also due to the lack of comprehensive data describing investments over time. In this study, we present a quantitative study of cryptocurrency institutional investments based on a dataset collected for 1324 currencies in the period between 2014 and 2022 from Crunchbase, one of the largest platforms gathering business information. We show that the evolution of the cryptocurrency market capitalization is highly correlated with the size of institutional investments, thus confirming their important role. Further, we find that the market is dominated by the presence of a group of prominent investors who tend to specialise by focusing on particular technologies. Finally, studying the co-investment network of currencies that share common investors, we show that assets with shared investors tend to be characterized by similar market behavior. Our work sheds light on the role played by institutional investors and provides a basis for further research on their influence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem."

In large metropolitan areas, the integration of different transport modes has become crucial to guarantee the fast and sustainable flow of people. Using a network science approach, multimodal transport systems can be described as multilayer networks, where the networks associated to different transport modes are not considered in isolation, but as a set of interconnected layers. Despite the importance of multimodality in modern cities, a unified view of the topic is currently missing. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging research areas of multilayer transport networks and multimodal urban mobility, focusing on contributions from the interdisciplinary fields of complex systems, urban data science, and science of cities.

To gain physical understanding of the activation order of the SBN links during tensile loading, we develop an analytical model based on the continuum theory of irreversible deformation. The results are used to construct an efficient, parameter-free indicator of the material strength that is solely based on the particle size and spatial distribution, thus proving that network science can advance the understanding of strength mechanisms in ductile solids."

Finally, we discuss urban transport from a systemic perspective, including system-wide challenges like ridesharing, multimodality, and sustainable transport."

The granular nature of these datasets calls for the design of summary statistics that can be used to describe succinctly mobility patterns. In this work, we show that the radius of gyration, a popular summary statistic to quantify the extent of an individual's whereabouts, suffers from a sensitivity to outliers, and is incapable of capturing mobility organised around multiple centres. We propose a natural generalisation of the radius of gyration to a polycentric setting, as well as a novel metric to assess the quality of its description. With these notions, we propose a method to identify the centres in an individual's mobility and apply it to two large mobility datasets with socio-demographic features, showing that a polycentric description can capture features that a monocentric model is incapable of."

      "abstract": "Dark markets are commercial websites that use Bitcoin to sell or broker transactions involving drugs, weapons, and other illicit goods. Being illegal, they do not offer any user protection, and several police raids and scams have caused large losses to both customers and vendors over the past years. However, this uncertainty has not prevented a steady growth of the dark market phenomenon and a proliferation of new markets. The origin of this resilience have remained unclear so far, also due to the difficulty of identifying relevant Bitcoin transaction data. Here, we investigate how the dark market ecosystem re-organises following the disappearance of a market, due to factors including raids and scams. To do so, we analyse 24 episodes of unexpected market closure through a novel datasets of 133 million Bitcoin transactions involving 31 dark markets and their users, totalling 4 billion USD. We show that coordinated user migration from the closed market to coexisting markets guarantees overall systemic resilience beyond the intrinsic fragility of individual markets. The migration is swift, efficient and common to all market closures. We find that migrants are on average more active users in comparison to non-migrants and move preferentially towards the coexisting market with the highest trading volume. Our findings shed light on the resilience of the dark market ecosystem and we anticipate that they may inform future research on the self-organisation of emerging online markets."

The original method used only GPS location estimations calculated at the same second as a corresponding WiFi scan. Here, we consider all location estimations from Android Location API, including network based estimations. Additionally, we relax the same-second requirement as follows. In the spatio-temporal trace of each user we identify periods from time t0 to time tN where the user was stationary, also referred to as stop locations. This means that the distance between the user\u2019s location at t0 and tN is below d meters, and that there exist a location estimation between t0 and tN at least every n seconds. Also, it implies that each location estimation within the stop location is within d from the user\u2019s location at tN. At tN, the individual stop-location changes. We select n as 305 seconds, thus requiring no missing data, since the sampling period of GPS location in the experiment is approximately 300 seconds. We select d as 30 meters, a safe range compared to the typical GPS errors, thus requiring that the user remains in the same location within the resolution of a building. After identifying these stop locations, we assign the geometric median position of estimations to all routers scanned in these periods."
