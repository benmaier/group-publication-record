    "abstract": "Predictive models for human mobility have important applications in many fields including traffic control, ubiquitous computing, and contextual advertisement. The predictive performance of models in literature varies quite broadly, from over 90% to under 40%. In this work we study which underlying factors - in terms of modeling approaches and spatio-temporal characteristics of the data sources - have resulted in this remarkably broad span of performance reported in the literature. Specifically we investigate which factors influence the accuracy of next-place prediction, using a high-precision location dataset of more than 400 users observed for periods between 3 months and one year. We show that it is much easier to achieve high accuracy when predicting the time-bin location than when predicting the next place. Moreover, we demonstrate how the temporal and spatial resolution of the data have strong \u2026"

    "abstract": "The weight of links in a network is often related to the similarity of the nodes. Here, we introduce a simple tunable measure for analysing the similarity of nodes across different link weights. In particular, we use the measure to analyze homophily in a group of 659 freshman students at a large university. Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom data collection software, complemented by questionnaire-based data. The network of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face contacts. We find that even strongly connected individuals are not more similar with respect to basic personality traits than randomly chosen pairs of individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels of acquaintanceships."

    "abstract": "Mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow determines neutrophil blood counts and thus is medically important. Balanced neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in neutrophil retention and egression ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to neutrophil egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retention signal predominated, egression time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice \u2026"

    "abstract": "Implementing a lockdown for disease mitigation is a balancing act: Non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce disease transmission significantly, but interventions also have considerable societal costs. Therefore, decision-makers need near real-time information to calibrate the level of restrictions. We fielded daily surveys in Denmark during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor public response to the announced lockdown. A key question asked respondents to state their number of close contacts within the past 24 hours. Here, we establish a link between survey data, mobility data, and, hospitalizations via epidemic modeling. Using Bayesian analysis, we then evaluate the usefulness of survey responses as a tool to monitor the effects of lockdown and then compare the predictive performance to that of mobility data. We find that, unlike mobility, self-reported contacts track the immediate behavioral response after the lockdown's announcement, weeks before the lockdown's national implementation. The survey data agree with the inferred effective reproduction number and their addition to the model results in greater improvement of predictive performance than mobility data. A detailed analysis of contact types indicates that disease transmission is driven by friends and strangers, whereas contacts to colleagues and family members (outside the household) only played a minor role despite Christmas holidays. Our work shows that an announcement of non-pharmaceutical interventions can lead to immediate behavioral responses, weeks before the actual implementation.

Existing research indicates that class attendance is a useful predictor of subsequent course achievements. The majority of the literature is, however, based on surveys and self-reports, methods which have well-known systematic biases that lead to limitations on conclusions and generalizability as well as being costly to implement. Here we propose a novel method for measuring class attendance that overcomes these limitations by using location and bluetooth data collected from smartphone sensors. Based on measured attendance data of nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, we demonstrate that early and consistent class attendance strongly correlates with academic performance. In addition, our novel dataset allows us to determine that attendance among social peers was substantially correlated (>0.5), suggesting either an important peer effect or homophily with respect to attendance."

    "abstract": "Data-driven research in mobility has prospered in recent years, providing solutions to real-world challenges including forecasting epidemics and planning transportation. These advancements were facilitated by computational tools enabling the analysis of large-scale data-sets of digital traces. One of the challenges when pre-processing spatial trajectories is the so-called stop location detection, that entails the reduction of raw time series to sequences of destinations where an individual was stationary. The most widely adopted solution to this problem was proposed by Hariharan and Toyama (2004) and involves filtering out non-stationary measurements, then applying agglomerative clustering on the stationary points. This state-of-the-art solution, however, suffers of two limitations: (i) frequently visited places located very close (such as adjacent buildings) are likely to be merged into a unique location, due to inherent measurement noise, (ii) traces for multiple users can not be analysed simultaneously, thus the definition of destination is not shared across users. In this paper, we describe the Infostop algorithm that overcomes the limitations of the state-of-the-art solution by leveraging the flow-based network community detection algorithm Infomap. We test Infostop for a population of  individuals with highly overlapping mobility. We show that the size of locations detected by Infostop saturates for increasing number of users and that time complexity grows slower than for previous solutions. We demonstrate that Infostop can be used to easily infer social meetings. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of Infostop, written in Python \u2026"

Their quality is affected by various factors and their relationship with epidemiological indicators varies over time. Here we adopt a model-free approach based on transfer entropy to quantify the relationship between mobile phone-derived mobility metrics and COVID-19 cases and deaths in more than 200 European subnational regions. We found that past knowledge of mobility does not provide statistically significant information on COVID-19 cases or deaths in most of the regions. In the remaining ones, measures of contact rates were often more informative than movements in predicting the spread of the disease, while the most predictive metrics between mid-range and short-range movements depended on the region considered. We finally identify geographic and demographic factors, such as users' coverage and commuting patterns, that can help determine the best metric for predicting disease incidence in a particular location.

Specifically, we describe the construction of dialectograms, an unsupervised way to visually explore the characteristic ways in which each community use a focal word. Based on these dialectograms, we provide a new measure of the degree to which words are used differently that overcomes the tendency for existing measures to pick out low frequent or polysemous words.

They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However, their potential for attenuating long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, commonly denoted as Long COVID, remains elusive and is still subject of debate. Such long-term effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors. Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity, and sleep duration in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by vaccination status. Data was collected over a period of two years in the context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with currently around 190,000 monthly active donors. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we find that vaccinated individuals on average experience smaller changes in their vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large scale, high-resolution wearable sensor data in public health research."

In the baseline scenario, the system-wide transitional CET1 ratio goes down from 15.5% in 2020 to its pre-pandemic level of 14.4%. In the adverse scenario, the CET1 ratio drops by 5.2 percentage points from 15.5% in 2020 to 10.3% in 2023. Macro-financial amplification in the macroprudential stress test results in higher capital depletion in the adverse scenario compared to the EBA/Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) stress test. Bank lending expands in the baseline scenario and shrinks in the adverse scenario. The outstanding COVID-19 mitigation policies have a pronounced positive lending effect, especially in the adverse scenario.

This abstraction allows for thorough quantitative analyses to investigate which structural and temporal features of a system influence the evolution of spreading processes, such as the passage of information or of infectious diseases. The first part of this work investigates how the ubiquitous modular hierarchical structure of static real-world networks allows for fast delivery of messages. New heuristics are developed to evaluate random walk mean first passage times and cover times on locally clustered networks. A comparison to average medium approximations shows that the emergence of these minima are pure network phenomena. It is further found that not all modular hierarchical network models provide optimal message delivery structure. In the second part, temporally varying face-to-face contact networks are investigated for their susceptibility to infection. Several studies have shown that people tend to spend time in small, densely-connected groups or in isolation, and that their connection behavior follows a circadian rhythm. To what extent both of these features influence the spread of diseases is as yet unclear. Therefore, a new temporal network model is devised here. Based on this model, circadially varying networks can for the first time be interpreted as following trajectories through a newly defined systemic state space. It is further revealed that in many temporally varying networks the system becomes less susceptible to infection when the time-scale of the disease approaches the time-scale of the network variation.

One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using \u2018social bots\u2019 deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses.

We propose a natural generalisation of the radius of gyration to a polycentric setting, as well as a novel metric to assess the quality of its description. With these notions, we propose a method to identify the centres in an individual's mobility and apply it to two large mobility datasets with socio-demographic features, showing that a polycentric description can capture features that a monocentric model is incapable of."

In longitudinal datasets across various domains, covering multiple decades, we find increasing gradients and shortened periods in the trajectories of how cultural items receive collective attention. Is this the inevitable conclusion of the way information is disseminated and consumed? Our findings support this hypothesis. Using a simple mathematical model of topics competing for finite collective attention, we are able to explain the empirical data remarkably well. Our modeling suggests that the accelerating ups and downs of popular content are driven by increasing production and consumption of content, resulting in a more rapid exhaustion of limited attention resources. In the interplay with competition for novelty, this causes \u2026"

In this paper, we propose to study the relationship between players' personality and game behavior in League of Legends (LoL), one of the most popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games. We use linear mixed effects (LME) models to describe relationships between players' personality traits (measured by the Five Factor Model) and two major aspects of the game: the impersonated roles and in-game actions. On the one hand, we study relationships within the game environment by modeling role attributes from match behaviors and vice versa. On the other hand, we analyze the relationship between a player's five personality traits and their game behavior by showing significant correlations \u2026"

    "abstract": "Recent advances in data collection have facilitated the access to time-resolved human proximity data that can conveniently be represented as temporal networks of contacts between individuals. While the structural and dynamical information revealed by this type of data is fundamental to investigate how information or diseases propagate in a population, data often suffer from incompleteness, which possibly leads to biased estimations in data-driven models. A major challenge is thus to estimate the outcome of spreading processes occurring on temporal networks built from partial information. To cope with this problem, we devise an approach based on non-negative tensor factorization, a dimensionality reduction technique from multilinear algebra. The key idea is to learn a low-dimensional representation of the temporal network built from partial information and to use it to construct a surrogate network similar to the \u2026"

The projects also make use of very different methods. In some cases, I seek to answer questions using calculations and simulations. Other projects are entirely data-driven.The diversity in projects is partially due to this work being funded by three different grants. The grants had very different scopes, and each provided one-third of the funding of this doctoral work. But the heterogeneity in topics also illustrates the fantastic importance of understanding how interactions of individual agents shape the world around us. Interactions are simply present in systems of all scales; big or small; biological, engineered, or social. Some interactions are of great importance, while others are nothing but noise."

However, in many practical applications, edge-level data are unavailable, and the network analyses must rely instead on node activity data which aggregates the edge-activity data and thus is less informative. This raises the question: Is it possible to use the static network to recover the richer edge activities from the node activities? Here we show that recovery is possible, often with a surprising degree of accuracy given how much information is lost, and that the recovered data are useful for subsequent network analysis tasks. Recovery is more difficult when network density increases, either topologically or dynamically, but exploiting dynamical and topological sparsity enables effective solutions to the recovery problem. We formally characterize the difficulty of the recovery problem both theoretically and empirically, proving the conditions under which recovery errors can be bounded and showing that, even when these conditions are not met, good quality solutions can still be derived. Effective recovery carries both promise and peril, as it enables deeper scientific study of complex systems but in the context of social systems also raises privacy concerns when social information can be aggregated across multiple data sources."

It reduces the complex spreading patterns of a pandemic to a wave-like propagation from the outbreak country, i.e. a linear relationship to the arrival time of the unmitigated spread of a disease. However, in the early stage of an outbreak, what matters to countries' decision makers is knowledge about the relative risk of arrival of active cases, i.e. how likely it is that an active case that boarded at the outbreak location will arrive in their country. As accurate mechanistic models to estimate such risks are still lacking, we propose here the ``import risk'' model that defines an import probability by means of the effective-distance framework. The model assumes that airline passengers are distributed along the shortest path tree that starts at the outbreak's origin. In combination with a random walk, we account for all possible paths, thus inferring predominant connecting flights. Our model outperforms other mobility models, such as the radiation and gravity model with varying distance types, and it improves further if additional geographic information is included. The import risk model's precision increases for countries that are more connected within the WAN, and recovers a geographic distance-dependence that suggests a pull- rather than a push-dynamic of the distribution process."

To avoid such effects we apply the so-called Ewald method, which has its origin in plasma physics. The basic idea of Ewald's method is to consider a finite number of dyons inside a finite cubic volume and enforce periodicity of this volume. In this talk we apply Ewalds method to the logarithmic dyon potential, which is then used to simulate an ensemble of dyons by means of Monte Carlo methods.

A major challenge is scaling network embedding approaches to very large networks and a drawback of LDM is the computational cost invoked evaluating the full likelihood having O(N^2) complexity, making such analysis of large networks infeasible. We propose a novel multiscale hierarchical estimate of the full likelihood of LDMs providing high details where the likelihood approximation is most important while scaling in complexity at O(NlogN). The approach relies on a clustering procedure approximating the Euclidean norm of every node pair according to the multiscale hierarchical structure imposed. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation and for the first time embed very large networks in the order of a million nodes using LDM and contrast the predictive performance to prominent scalable graph embedding approaches. We find that our approach significantly outperforms these existing scalable approaches in the ability to perform link prediction, node clustering, and classification utilizing a surprisingly low embedding dimensionality of two to three dimensions whereas the extracted hierarchical structure facilitates network visualization and interpretation.

Nevertheless, we still lack a good understanding of how these structures emerge from individual behaviour. Here we present a general model for the emergence of social structures, which is based on a key aspect of real social systems observed across species, namely social preferences for traits (individual characteristics such as age, sex, etc.). We first show that the model can generate diverse artificial social structures, and consider its potential for being combined with real network data. We then use the model to gain fundamental insights into how two main categories of social preferences (similarity and popularity) affect social structure and function. The results show that the types of social preference, in combination with the types of trait they are used with, can have important consequences for the spread of information and disease, and the robustness of social structures against fragmentation. The results also suggest that symmetric degree distributions could be expected to be common in social networks. More generally, the study implies that trait-based social preferences can have consequences for social systems that go far beyond their effect on direct benefits from social partners. We discuss the implications of the results for social evolution."

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging research areas of multilayer transport networks and multimodal urban mobility, focusing on contributions from the interdisciplinary fields of complex systems, urban data science, and science of cities.

We review modelling approaches and observational evidence in multimodal mobility and public transport system dynamics, focusing on integrated real-world mobility patterns, where individuals navigate urban systems using different transport modes.

    "abstract": "The digital traces we leave behind when engaging with the modern world offer an interesting lens through which we study behavioral patterns as expression of gender. Although gender differentiation has been observed in a number of settings, the majority of studies focus on a single data stream in isolation. Here we use a dataset of high resolution data collected using mobile phones, as well as detailed questionnaires, to study gender differences in a large cohort. We consider mobility behavior and individual personality traits among a group of more than 800 university students. We also investigate interactions among them expressed via person-to-person contacts, interactions on online social networks, and telecommunication. Thus, we are able to study the differences between male and female behavior captured through a multitude of channels for a single cohort. We find that while the two genders are similar in a number of aspects, there are robust deviations that include multiple facets of social interactions, suggesting the existence of inherent behavioral differences. Finally, we quantify how aspects of an individual\u2019s characteristics and social behavior reveals their gender by posing it as a classification problem. We ask: How well can we distinguish between male and female study participants based on behavior alone? Which behavioral features are most predictive?"

The original method used only GPS location estimations calculated at the same second as a corresponding WiFi scan. Here, we consider all location estimations from Android Location API, including network based estimations. Additionally, we relax the same-second requirement as follows. In the spatio-temporal trace of each user we identify periods from time t0 to time tN where the user was stationary, also referred to as stop locations. This means that the distance between the user\u2019s location at t0 and tN is below d meters, and that there exist a location estimation between t0 and tN at least every n seconds. Also, it implies that each location estimation within the stop location is within d from the user\u2019s location at tN. At tN, the individual stop-location changes. We select n as 305 seconds, thus requiring no missing data, since the sampling period of GPS location in the experiment is approximately 300 seconds. We select d as 30 meters, a safe range compared to the typical GPS errors, thus requiring that the user remains in the same location within the resolution of a building. After identifying these stop locations, we assign the geometric median position of estimations to all routers scanned in these periods."

    "abstract": "Humans, like almost all animals, are phase-locked to the diurnal cycle. Most of us sleep at night and are active through the day. Because we have evolved to function with this cycle, the circadian rhythm is deeply ingrained and even detectable at the biochemical level. However, within the broader day-night pattern, there are individual differences: e.g., some of us are intrinsically morning-active, while others prefer evenings. In this article, we look at digital daily cycles: circadian patterns of activity viewed through the lens of auto-recorded data of communication and online activity. We begin at the aggregate level, discuss earlier results, and illustrate differences between population-level daily rhythms in different media. Then we move on to the individual level, and show that there is a strong individual-level variation beyond averages: individuals typically have their distinctive daily pattern that persists in time. We conclude by discussing the driving forces behind these signature daily patterns, from personal traits (morningness/eveningness) to variation in activity level and external constraints, and outline possibilities for future research."

We phrase our problem of predicting future encounters as a link-prediction problem and utilise set of Random Forest predictors for the prediction task. We use data collected by the Copenhagen network study; a study unique in scope and scale and tracks 847 students via mobile phones over the course of a whole academic year.

    "abstract": "Across the world, countries are fighting to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The backbone of the response is a test-trace-isolate strategy, where suspected infected get tested and isolated and possible secondary cases get traced, tested and isolated. Because more accurate tests often take longer to analyze, and the benefits of contact tracing are strengthened by rapid diagnosis, there exists a trade-off in test sensitivity and test waiting time in test-trace-isolate strategies. Here we ask: How many false negatives can be tolerated in a rapid test so that it reduces transmission better than a slower, more accurate test? How does this change with contact tracing efficiency and test waiting time? We find that a rapid, less sensitive test performs best for many test-parameter choices and that this is true even for modest contact tracing efficiency. For COVID-19-like viral parameters, a test with 40% false negatives and immediate result might reduce transmission as well as a test with no false negatives and a 3-day waiting time. Our analysis suggests employing rapid tests to reduce test waiting times as a viable strategy to reduce transmission when testing infrastructure is under stress."

    "abstract": "The global public sphere has changed dramatically over the past decades: a significant part of public discourse now takes place on algorithmically driven platforms owned by a handful of private companies. Despite its growing importance, there is scant large-scale academic research on the long-term evolution of user behaviour on these platforms, because the data are often proprietary to the platforms. Here, we evaluate the individual behaviour of 600,000 Twitter users between 2012 and 2019 and find empirical evidence for an acceleration of the way Twitter is used on an individual level. This manifests itself in the fact that cohorts of Twitter users behave differently depending on when they joined the platform. Behaviour within a cohort is relatively consistent over time and characterised by strong internal interactions, but over time behaviour from cohort to cohort shifts towards increased activity. Specifically, we measure this in terms of more tweets per user over time, denser interactions with others via retweets, and shorter content horizons, expressed as an individual's decaying autocorrelation of topics over time. Our observations are explained by a growing proportion of active users who not only tweet more actively but also elicit more retweets. These behaviours suggest a collective contribution to an increased flow of information through each cohort's news feed -- an increase that potentially depletes available collective attention over time. Our findings complement recent, empirical work on social acceleration, which has been largely agnostic about individual user activity."

Scholars are intensively investigating the societal drivers and resultant impacts of this collective shift in our allocation of time and attention. Yet, the external factors that regularly shape online behavior remain markedly understudied. Do environmental factors alter rates of online activity? Here we show that adverse meteorological conditions markedly increase social media use in the United States. To do so, we employ climate econometric methods alongside over three and a half billion social media posts from tens of millions of individuals from both Facebook and Twitter between 2009 and 2016. We find that more extreme temperatures and added precipitation each independently amplify social media activity. Weather that is adverse on both the temperature and precipitation dimensions produces markedly larger increases in social media activity. On average across both platforms, compared to the temperate weather baseline, days colder than -5{\\deg}C with 1.5-2cm of precipitation elevate social media activity by 35%. This effect is nearly three times the typical increase in social media activity observed on New Year's Eve in New York City. We observe meteorological effects on social media participation at both the aggregate and individual level, even accounting for individual-specific, temporal, and location-specific potential confounds."

To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals, as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes, and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases."

Due to their structural similarity to written language, transformer-based architectures have also shown promise as tools to make sense of a range of multi-variate sequences from protein-structures, music, electronic health records to weather-forecasts. We can also represent human lives in a way that shares this structural similarity to language. From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People are born, visit the pediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get married, and so on. Here, we exploit this similarity to adapt innovations from natural language processing to examine the evolution and predictability of human lives based on detailed event sequences. We do this by drawing on arguably the most comprehensive registry data in existence, available for an entire nation of more than six million individuals across decades. Our data include information about life-events related to health, education, occupation, income, address, and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution. We create embeddings of life-events in a single vector space showing that this embedding space is robust and highly structured. Our models allow us to predict diverse outcomes ranging from early mortality to personality nuances, outperforming state-of-the-art models by a wide margin. Using methods for interpreting deep learning models, we probe the algorithm to understand the factors that enable our predictions.

Even though it has been studied for over 150 years, there is neither a complete theoretical description of thermophoresis in liquids nor of the Soret coefficient, the quantifiying measure of the Soret equilibrium. Recent studies connect its nature to equilibrium properties of the system, namely the excess enthalpy and the excess entropy, while there is still a debate over which of both describes the Soret coefficient more accurately and whether it can even be represented using those quantities. In this work I present a theoretical description for both cases based on density analysis by means of Brownian motion and dynamical density functional theory, where I assume local equilibrium. The interpretation of the Brownian stochastic differential equation (SDE) as an Ito or Stratonovich SDE is shown to have an influence on the outcome of the density. I argue that a Soret coefficient proportional to the excess enthalpy is connected to a system in a thermal gradient following its equation of state. Furthermore, I derive that the Boltzmann distribution law for external potentials does not hold for systems in thermal gradients but has to be replaced by a more general quantity. The theoretical predictions are consequently tested by means of BD simulations, where several systems are shown to follow their equation of state. The Soret coefficient of a solute in a toy model solvent is shown to be proportional to the solute's equilibrium solvation enthalpy. I further attempt to verify the theoretic derivations by means of MD simulations of noble gas solutes in SPC/E water \u2026"

In addition, we assessed how the deployment of this technology could help improve future simulations by analyzing the flow of patients in the hospital.Data were obtained and collected through the deployment of wearable proximity sensors during an MCI functional exercise. The scenario included 2 areas: the accident site and the Advanced Medical Post, and the exercise lasted 3 hours. A total of 238 participants were involved in the exercise and classified in categories according to their role: 14 medical doctors, 16 nurses, 134 victims, 47 Emergency Medical Services staff members, and 27 health care assistants and other hospital support staff.

The overall number of tweets is represented by a density-preserving cartogram, while the actual land area of states is sized by the number of tweets in that region. The mood of each tweet was inferred using ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words), a list of words rated for their emotional valence.

Here we present an anomaly detection approach for temporal graph data, based on an iterative tensor decomposition and masking procedure. We test this approach using high-resolution social network data from wearable proximity sensors. The dataset includes metadata that allow to independently build a ground truth, used to validate the anomaly detection method. Our approach achieves high accuracy in identifying meso-scale network anomalies due to sensor wearing protocol, proving the practical viability of the method for a real-world application."

With the aim of striking a balance between effective mitigation and long-term sustainability, several governments worldwide have adopted systems of tiered interventions, of increasing stringency, that are calibrated according to periodic risk assessments. A key challenge remains in quantifying temporal changes in adherence to interventions, which can decrease over time due to pandemic fatigue, under such kind of multilevel strategies. Here, we examine whether there was a reduction in adherence to tiered restrictions that were imposed in Italy from November 2020 through May 2021, and in particular we assess whether temporal trends in adherence depended on the intensity of the restrictions adopted. We analyzed daily changes in movements and in residential time, combining mobility data with the restriction tier enforced in the Italian regions. Through mixed-effects regression models, we identified a general trend of reduction in adherence and an additional effect of faster waning associated with the most stringent tier. We estimated both effects being of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that adherence decreased twice as fast during the strictest tier as in the least stringent one. Our results provide a quantitative measure of behavioral responses to tiered interventions\u2014a metric of pandemic fatigue\u2014that can be integrated into mathematical models to evaluate future epidemic scenarios."

Our methodology includes Topic Modelling (Pachinko Allocation [1]), word embeddings [2], Ward\u2019s hierarchical cluster analysis [3], and network analysis [4]. Our results show a progressive simplification of semantic fields over time, reflecting less polarizing views across countries and, therefore, showing an increasing agreement on sustainability-related discourses in our contemporary societies.

The internal clock in each cell is based on a negative feedback loop which couples to the clocks of neighboring cells through a Notch mechanism. We investigate how a morphogen gradient in the mesoderm, which affects the period of oscillating cells, gives rise to phase waves traveling from the posterior to the anterior part of the PSM. We show that the phase waves can be entrained by an external periodic variation in this morphogen and also observe that multiple oscillatory solutions can coexist in the cell population. Together, these provide a way to potentially control phase waves and thereby manipulate somite patterning in embryos, based on entrainment properties of coupled nonlinear oscillators."

In this study, we present a quantitative study of cryptocurrency institutional investments based on a dataset collected for 1324 currencies in the period between 2014 and 2022 from Crunchbase, one of the largest platforms gathering business information. We show that the evolution of the cryptocurrency market capitalization is highly correlated with the size of institutional investments, thus confirming their important role. Further, we find that the market is dominated by the presence of a group of prominent investors who tend to specialise by focusing on particular technologies. Finally, studying the co-investment network of currencies that share common investors, we show that assets with shared investors tend to be characterized by similar market behavior.

Researchers have since been working on a large number of different models that are used to forecast case numbers, to analyze the implications of different contact structures between individual people, or to discuss the influence of various mitigation and containment strategies, to only name a few applications (Estrada, 2020).The complexity of detailed epidemiological models often mitigates simple replication and/or adaptation to local circumstances. Typically, modifications are quickly thought up, but their influence on system properties such as the epidemic threshold or outbreak size are less clear. Variations in model formulation often entail the reimplementation of simulation and analysis frameworks for every model iteration, taking up valuable time and resources for debugging and reanalysis. Furthermore, researchers often need to cross-check their results by implementing both deterministic well-mixed models as well as models that consider explicit contact structures (ie, static or temporal networks).

However, it is not clear how existing relationships between team members should be quantified, and whether some relationships are more likely to occur in new collaborations than others. Here we introduce a new family of structural patterns, m-patterns, which formalize relationships between collaborators and we study the prevalence of such structures in data and a simple random-hypergraph null model. We analyze the frequency with which different collaboration structures appear in our null model and show how such frequencies depend on size and hyperedge density in the hypergraphs. Comparing the null model to data of human and non-human collaborations, we find that some collaboration structures are vastly under- and overrepresented in empirical datasets. Finally, we find that structures of scientific collaborations on COVID-19 papers in some cases are statistically significantly different from those of non-COVID-19 papers. Examining citation counts for 4 different scientific fields, we also find indications that repeat collaborations are more successful for 2-author scientific publications and less successful for 3-author scientific publications as compared to other collaboration structures."

We found that past knowledge of mobility does not provide statistically significant information on COVID-19 cases or deaths in most of the regions. In the remaining ones, measures of contact rates were often more informative than movements in predicting the spread of the disease, while the most predictive metrics between mid-range and short-range movements depended on the region considered. We finally identify geographic and demographic factors, such as users' coverage and commuting patterns, that can help determine the best metric for predicting disease incidence in a particular location.

Our work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of individual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network \u2026"

This infrastructure offers important opportunities for sensing and recording a multitude of human behaviors. Human mobility patterns are a prominent example of such a behavior which has been studied based on cell phone towers, Bluetooth beacons, and WiFi networks as proxies for location. While mobility is an important aspect of human behavior, it is also crucial to study physical interactions among individuals. Sensing proximity that enables social interactions on a large scale is a technical challenge and many commonly used approaches\u2014including RFID badges or Bluetooth scanning\u2014offer only limited scalability. Here we show that it is possible, in a scalable and robust way, to accurately infer person-to-person physical proximity from the lists of WiFi access points measured by smartphones carried by the two individuals \u2026"

    "title": "Characterizing Polarization in Social Networks using the Signed Relational Latent Distance Model",
    "abstract": "Graph representation learning has become a prominent tool for the characterization and understanding of the structure of networks in general and social networks in particular. Typically, these representation learning approaches embed the networks into a low-dimensional space in which the role of each individual can be characterized in terms of their latent position. A major current concern in social networks is the emergence of polarization and filter bubbles promoting a mindset of \"us-versus-them\" that may be defined by extreme positions believed to ultimately lead to political violence and the erosion of democracy. Such polarized networks are typically characterized in terms of signed links reflecting likes and dislikes. We propose the latent Signed relational Latent dIstance Model (SLIM) utilizing for the first time the Skellam distribution as a likelihood function for signed networks and extend the modeling to the characterization of distinct extreme positions by constraining the embedding space to polytopes. On four real social signed networks of polarization, we demonstrate that the model extracts low-dimensional characterizations that well predict friendships and animosity while providing interpretable visualizations defined by extreme positions when endowing the model with an embedding space restricted to polytopes."

Such an effective collective action was unprecedented in finance, and its dynamics remain unclear. Here, we analyse Reddit and financial data and rationalize the events based on recent findings describing how a small fraction of committed individuals may trigger behavioural cascades.

In social media sentiment analysis and related tasks, researchers have therefore used binarized emoticons and specific hashtags as forms of distant supervision.

Through emoji prediction on a dataset of 1246 million tweets containing one of 64 common emojis we obtain state-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmark datasets within sentiment, emotion and sarcasm detection using a single pretrained model. Our analyses confirm that the diversity of our emotional labels yield a performance improvement over previous distant supervision approaches."

Being illegal, they do not offer any user protection, and several police raids and scams have caused large losses to both customers and vendors over the past years. However, this uncertainty has not prevented a steady growth of the dark market phenomenon and a proliferation of new markets. The origin of this resilience have remained unclear so far, also due to the difficulty of identifying relevant Bitcoin transaction data. Here, we investigate how the dark market ecosystem re-organises following the disappearance of a market, due to factors including raids and scams. To do so, we analyse 24 episodes of unexpected market closure through a novel datasets of 133 million Bitcoin transactions involving 31 dark markets and their users, totalling 4 billion USD. We show that coordinated user migration from the closed market to coexisting markets guarantees overall systemic resilience beyond the intrinsic fragility of individual markets. The migration is swift, efficient and common to all market closures. We find that migrants are on average more active users in comparison to non-migrants and move preferentially towards the coexisting market with the highest trading volume. Our findings shed light on the resilience of the dark market ecosystem and we anticipate that they may inform future research on the self-organisation of emerging online markets."

Initially, enthusiasm was high regarding their implementation as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). However, no country was able to prevent larger outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs. Here, we discuss results of a stochastic infectious-disease model that provide insights in how the progression of an outbreak and key parameters such as detection probability, app participation and its distribution, as well as engagement of users impact DCT efficacy informed by results of empirical studies. We further show how contact heterogeneity and local contact clustering impact the intervention\u2019s efficacy. We conclude that DCT apps might have prevented cases on the order of single-digit percentages during single outbreaks for empirically plausible ranges of parameters, ignoring that a substantial part of these contacts would have been identified by manual contact tracing. This result is generally robust against changes in network topology with exceptions for homogeneous-degree, locally-clustered contact networks, on which the intervention prevents more infections. An improvement of efficacy is similarly observed when app participation is highly clustered. We find that DCT typically averts more cases during the super-critical phase of an epidemic when case counts are rising and the measured efficacy therefore depends on the time of evaluation."

Key quantities such as rank, Weierstrass coefficients, period, conductor, Tamagawa number, regulator and order of the Tate-Shafarevich group give rise to a high-dimensional point-cloud whose statistical properties we investigate.

In numerical treatments, the long-range tails of the dyon fields cause severe finite-volume effects. Therefore, we demonstrate the application of Ewald\u2019s summation method to this system.

Sustained community transmission favors the proliferation of mutated sub-lineages with pandemic potential, due to cross-national mobility flows, which are responsible for consecutive cases surge worldwide. We show that, in the early stages of an emerging variant, integrating data from national genomic surveillance and global human mobility with large-scale epidemic modeling allows to quantify its pandemic potential, providing quantifiable indicators for pro-active policy interventions. We validate our framework on worldwide spreading variants and gain insights about the pandemic potential of BA.5, BA.2.75 and other sub- and lineages. We combine the different sources of information in a simple estimate of the pandemic delay and show that only in combination, the pandemic potentials of the lineages are correctly assessed relative to each other. Country-level epidemic intelligence is not enough to contrast the pandemic of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and a scalable integrated approach, i.e. pandemic intelligence, is required to enhance global preparedness."

Here, we show that the behaviour of participants in a game-theoretical experiment is driven mainly by social norms, and that participants' adherence to different social norms is influenced by the exposure to economic terminology. To explore how these terminology-driven changes impact behavior at the system level, we use established frameworks for modeling collective cooperative behaviour. We find that economic terminology induces a behavioural difference which is larger than that caused by financial incentives in the magnitude usually employed in experiments \u2026"

    "abstract": "Cooperative behaviour constitutes a key aspect of both human society and non-human animal systems, but explaining how cooperation evolves represents a major scientific challenge. It is now well established that social network structure plays a central role for the viability of cooperation. However, not much is known about the importance of the positions of cooperators in the networks for the evolution of cooperation. Here, we investigate how cooperation is affected by correlations between cooperativeness and individual social connectedness. Using simulation models, we find that the effect of correlation between cooperativeness and connectedness (degree) depends on the social network structure, with positive effect in standard scale-free networks and no effect in standard Poisson networks. Furthermore, when degree assortativity is increased such that individuals cluster with others of similar social connectedness, we find that bridge areas between social clusters can act as barriers to the spread of defection, leading to strong enhancement of cooperation in particular in Poisson networks. But this effect is sensitive to the presence of Trojan horses (defectors placed within cooperator clusters). The study provides new knowledge about the conditions under which cooperation may evolve and persist, and the results are also relevant to consider in regard to human cooperation experiments."

This development has been partially driven by individuals posting and storing data about themselves and friends using online social networks or collecting their data for self-tracking purposes (quantified-self movement). Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies collecting data with an unprecedented resolution and scale. Using computational power combined with mathematical models, such rich datasets can be mined to infer underlying patterns, thereby providing insights into human nature. Much of the data collected is sensitive. It is private in the sense that most individuals would feel uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data publicly. For this reason, the need for solutions to ensure the privacy of the individuals generating data has grown alongside the data collection efforts. Out of all the massive data collection efforts, this paper focuses on efforts directly instrumenting human behavior, and notes that -- in many cases -- the privacy of participants is not sufficiently addressed. For example, study purposes are often not explicit, informed consent is ill-defined, and security and sharing protocols are only partially disclosed. This paper provides a survey of the work related to addressing privacy issues in research studies that collect detailed sensor data on human behavior.

The basic idea of Ewald's method is to consider a finite number of dyons inside a finite cubic volume and enforce periodicity of this volume.

To identify possible transmission routes, we applied combined genomics and contact-network modeling to retrospectively evaluate routine VRE screening data generated by the infection control program of a hemato-oncology unit. Over 1 year, a total of 111 VRE isolates from 111 patients were collected by anal swabs in a tertiary care hospital in Southern Germany. All isolated VRE were whole-genome sequenced, followed by different in-depth bioinformatics analyses including genotyping and determination of phylogenetic relations, aiming to evaluate a standardized workflow. Patient movement data were used to overlay sequencing data to infer transmission events and strain dynamics over time. A predominant clone harboring vanB and exhibiting genotype ST117/CT469 (n = 67) was identified. Our comprehensive combined analyses suggested intra-hospital spread, especially of clone ST117/CT469, despite of extensive screening, single room placement, and contact isolation. A new interactive tool to visualize these complex data was designed. Furthermore, a patient-contact network-modeling approach was developed, which indicates both the periodic import of the clone into the hospital and its spread within the hospital due to patient movements. The analyzed spread of VRE was most likely due to placement of patients in the same room prior to positivity of screening.

    "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy is currently recognized by the WHO as a major threat to global health. Recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in the role of social media in the propagation of false information and fringe narratives regarding vaccination. Using a sample of approximately 60 billion tweets, we conduct a large-scale analysis of the vaccine discourse on Twitter. We use methods from deep learning and transfer learning to estimate the vaccine sentiments expressed in tweets, then categorize individual-level user attitude towards vaccines. Drawing on an interaction graph representing mutual interactions between users, we analyze the interplay between vaccine stances, interaction network, and the information sources shared by users in vaccine-related contexts. We find that strongly anti-vaccine users frequently share content from sources of a commercial nature; typically sources which sell alternative health products for profit. An interesting aspect of this finding is that concerns regarding commercial conflicts of interests are often cited as one of the major factors in vaccine hesitancy. Further, we show that the debate is highly polarized, in the sense that users with similar stances on vaccination interact preferentially with one another. Extending this insight, we provide evidence of an epistemic echo chamber effect, where users are exposed to highly dissimilar sources of vaccine information, depending the vaccination stance of their contacts. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing vaccine mis- and dis-information in the context in which they are disseminated in social networks."

We gain insights by using network analysis and by visualising the temporal unfolding of the design process. Subsequently, we develop a statistical model to rigorously test multiple hypotheses showing that iterations are a combination of technical and social factors.

We show analytically, that the quark-antiquark free energy from the Polyakov loop correlator grows linearly with the distance, and how the string tension scales with the dyon density. In numerical treatments, the long-range tails of the dyon fields cause severe finite-volume effects. Therefore, we demonstrate the application of Ewald's summation method to this system. Finite-volume effects are shown to be under control, which is a crucial requirement for numerical studies of interacting dyon ensembles."

First, we confirmed that non-receptive females were harassed less when they were paired with a more sexually attractive (receptive) female than with another non-receptive female.

To this aim, we collect the entire gaming history of a group of about 1000 players, which accounts for roughly 100K matches. By applying our framework we are able to separate players into different groups.

Often, however, real-world data are prohibitively expensive to collect or unshareable due to privacy concerns. A promising solution is `surrogate networks', synthetic graphs with the properties of real-world networks. Until now, the generation of realistic surrogate temporal networks has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of capturing both the temporal and topological properties of the input network, as well as their correlations, in a scalable model. Here, we propose a novel and simple method for generating surrogate temporal networks. By decomposing graphs into temporal neighborhoods surrounding each node, we can generate new networks using neighborhoods as building blocks. Our model vastly outperforms current methods across multiple examples of temporal networks in terms of both topological and dynamical similarity. We further show that beyond generating realistic interaction patterns, our method is able to capture intrinsic temporal periodicity of temporal networks, all with an execution time lower than competing methods by multiple orders of magnitude."

However, half are unaware that climate change is human-caused, and those who are most affected appear to be least aware. An Inuit cultural dimension, indicated by the intertwined social ecological factors of Indigenous identity, subsistence occupation, village community scale and no post-elementary education, proves to be the main positive predictor of climate change experience but also the strongest negative predictor of awareness of human-caused climate change. Despite Greenland\u2019s centrality to climate research, we uncover a widespread gap between the scientific consensus and coastal Kalaallit views of climate change, particularly among the country\u2019s youth, fishers, and hunters.

The work in these projects is either done manually by human editors (Russell, 2008: http://labelme. csail. mit. edu/; Schich, 2007; more examples see Obrenovic, 2007), automatically with the help of pattern recognition algorithms (see for eg http://www. definiens. com) or most promising by human computation, ie in a collaborative effort in the form of games such as Peekaboom (Ahn, 2006: http://www. peekaboom. org/).The data produced by these efforts can be understood as a bi-partite network with image documents in one partition and (visual) classification criteria in the other. Typically in addition, the image documents as well as the classification criteria in each partition may feature more structure in the form of trees or ontologies. Fig. 1 shows a simple example of this structure, where a painting and its classified segments (a) can be represented as a simple tree (b), which is connected to the partition of classifications via the classification link."

    "abstract": "Human mobility patterns are inherently complex. In terms of understanding these patterns, the process of converting raw data into series of stop-locations and transitions is an important first step which greatly reduces the volume of data, thus simplifying the subsequent analyses. Previous research into the mobility of individuals has focused on inferring \u2018stop locations\u2019 (places of stationarity) from GPS or CDR data, or on detection of state (static/active). In this paper we bridge the gap between the two approaches: we introduce methods for detecting both mobility state and stop-locations. In addition, our methods are based exclusively on WiFi data. We study two months of WiFi data collected every two minutes by a smartphone, and infer stop-locations in the form of labelled time-intervals. For this purpose, we investigate two algorithms, both of which scale to large datasets: a greedy approach to select the most important routers and one which uses a density-based clustering algorithm to detect router fingerprints. We validate our results using participants\u2019 GPS data as well as ground truth data collected during a two month period."

The social structures of these systems can be studied in depth by means of network analysis. A large number of studies on animal social networks in many species have in recent years been carried out in the biological research field of animal behaviour and have provided new insights into behaviour, ecology and social evolution. This line of research is currently not so well connected to the field of complex systems as could be expected. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to animal social networks for complex systems scientists and highlight areas of synergy. We believe that an increased integration of animal social networks with the interdisciplinary field of complex systems, and networks would be beneficial for various reasons. Increased collaboration between researchers in this field and biologists studying animal social systems could be valuable in solving challenges that are of importance to animal social network research. Furthermore, animal social networks provide the opportunity to investigate hypotheses about complex systems across a range of natural real-world social systems. In this article, we describe what animal social networks are and main research themes where they are studied; we give an overview of the methods commonly used to study animal social networks; we highlight challenges in the study of animal social networks where complex systems expertise may be particularly valuable; and we consider aspects of animal social networks that may be of particular interest to complex systems researchers.

However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large \u2026"

Recently, leakage due to distribution inference (or property inference) attacks is gaining attention. In this attack, the goal of an adversary is to infer distributional information about the training data. So far, research on distribution inference has focused on demonstrating successful attacks, with little attention given to identifying the potential causes of the leakage and to proposing mitigations. To bridge this gap, as our main contribution, we theoretically and empirically analyze the sources of information leakage that allows an adversary to perpetrate distribution inference attacks. We identify three sources of leakage: (1) memorizing specific information about the  (expected label given the feature values) of interest to the adversary, (2) wrong inductive bias of the model, and (3) finiteness of the training data. Next, based on our analysis, we propose principled mitigation techniques against distribution inference attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate that causal learning techniques are more resilient to a particular type of distribution inference risk termed distributional membership inference than associative learning methods. And lastly, we present a formalization of distribution inference that allows for reasoning about more general adversaries than was previously possible."

The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated researchers to examine how different contact tracing strategies compare in terms of effectiveness (ability to mitigate infections) and cost efficiency (number of prevented infections per isolation). Two important strategies are so-called forward contact tracing (tracing to whom disease spreads) and backward contact tracing (tracing from whom disease spreads). Recently, Kojaku and colleagues reported that backward contact tracing was ``profoundly more effective'' than forward contact tracing, that contact tracing effectiveness ``hinges on reaching the `source' of infection'', and that contact tracing outperformed case isolation in terms of cost efficiency. Here we show that these conclusions are not true in general. They were based in part on simulations that vastly overestimated the effectiveness and efficiency of contact tracing. Our results show that the efficiency of contact tracing strategies is highly contextual; faced with a disease outbreak, the disease dynamics determine whether tracing infection sources or new cases is more impactful. Our results also demonstrate the importance of simulating disease spread and mitigation measures in parallel rather than sequentially."

We find that statistics of the entire population allows us to successfully predict 71% of the activity and 85% of the inactivity involved in communication, mobility, and physical proximity. Surprisingly, individual level statistics only result in marginally better predictions, indicating that a majority of activity patterns are shared across our sample population.

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging research areas of multilayer transport networks and multimodal urban mobility, focusing on contributions from the interdisciplinary fields of complex systems, urban data science, and science of cities. First, we present an introduction to the mathematical framework of multilayer \u2026"

    "title": "Does streaming esports affect players\u2019 behavior and performance?",
    "abstract": "In this work, we analyze what effect streaming gameplay on Twitch has on players\u2019 in-game behavior and performance. We hypothesized that streaming can act as a form of implicit incentive to boost players\u2019 performance and engagement. To test this hypothesis, we continuously collected data about all Twitch streams related to a popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, League of Legends (LoL), and data of all LoL matches played during the same time frame, and cross-mapped the two data sets. We found that, counterintuitively, streaming significantly deteriorates players\u2019 in-game performance: This may be due to the burden of carrying out two cognitively intensive activities at the same time, namely, playing the game and producing its commentary for streaming purposes. On the other hand, streaming increases engagement keeping players in significantly longer game sessions. We investigate these \u2026"

    "title": "Fundamental structures in temporal communication networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper I introduce a framework for modeling temporal communication networks and dynamical processes unfolding on such networks. The framework originates from the (new) observation that there is a meaningful division of temporal communication networks into six dynamic classes, where the class of a network is determined by its generating process. In particular, each class is characterized by a fundamental structure: a temporal-topological network motif, which corresponds to the network representation of communication events in that class of network. These fundamental structures constrain network configurations: only certain configurations are possible within a dynamic class. In this way the framework presented here highlights strong constraints on network structures, which simplify analyses and shape network flows. Therefore the fundamental structures hold the potential to impact how we \u2026"

    "title": "Spreading in social systems: Reflections",
    "abstract": "In this final chapter, we consider the state-of-the-art for spreading in social systems and discuss the future of the field. As part of this reflection, we identify a set of key challenges ahead. The challenges include the following questions: how can we improve the quality, quantity, extent, and accessibility of datasets? How can we extract more information from limited datasets? How can we take individual cognition and decision-making processes into account? How can we incorporate other complexity of the real contagion processes? Finally, how can we translate research into positive real-world impact? In the following, we provide more context for each of these open questions."

    "title": "Inferring transportation mode from smartphone sensors: Evaluating the potential of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth",
    "abstract": "Understanding which transportation modes people use is critical for smart cities and planners to better serve their citizens. We show that using information from pervasive Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices can enhance GPS and geographic information to improve transportation detection on smartphones. Wi-Fi information also improves the identification of transportation mode and helps conserve battery since it is already collected by most mobile phones. Our approach uses a machine learning approach to determine the mode from pre-prepocessed data. This approach yields an overall accuracy of 89% and average F1 score of 83% for inferring the three grouped modes of self-powered, car-based, and public transportation. When broken out by individual modes, Wi-Fi features improve detection accuracy of bus trips, train travel, and driving compared to GPS features alone and can substitute for GIS features without decreasing performance. Our results suggest that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be useful in urban transportation research, for example by improving mobile travel surveys and urban sensing applications."

    "title": "Optimizing targeted vaccination across cyber\u2013physical networks: an empirically based mathematical simulation study",
    "abstract": "Targeted vaccination, whether to minimize the forward transmission of infectious diseases or their clinical impact, is one of the \u2018holy grails\u2019 of modern infectious disease outbreak response, yet it is difficult to achieve in practice due to the challenge of identifying optimal targets in real time. If interruption of disease transmission is the goal, targeting requires knowledge of underlying person-to-person contact networks. Digital communication networks may reflect not only virtual but also physical interactions that could result in disease transmission, but the precise overlap between these cyber and physical networks has never been empirically explored in real-life settings. Here, we study the digital communication activity of more than 500 individuals along with their person-to-person contacts at a 5-min temporal resolution. We then simulate different disease transmission scenarios on the person-to-person physical contact \u2026"
