      "abstract": "The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China was characterized by a distinctive subexponential increase of confirmed cases during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting with an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak. We show that this effect can be explained as a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end, we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals, as well as population-wide isolation practices in response to containment policies or behavioral changes, and show that the model captures the observed growth behavior accurately. The insights provided here may aid the careful implementation of containment strategies for ongoing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases."

Studies using digital data sources show that the mobility of individuals was effectively reduced in multiple countries. However, it remains unclear whether these reductions caused deeper structural changes in mobility networks and how such changes may affect dynamic processes on the network. Here we use movement data of mobile phone users to show that mobility in Germany has not only been reduced considerably: Lockdown measures caused substantial and long-lasting structural changes in the mobility network. We find that long-distance travel was reduced disproportionately strongly. The trimming of long-range network connectivity leads to a more local, clustered network and a moderation of the \u201csmall-world\u201d effect. We demonstrate that these structural changes have a \u2026"

The cover time is defined as the time a random walker requires to visit every node in the network at least once. This quantity is particularly important for random search processes and target localization on network structures. Based on the global mean first-passage time of target nodes, we derive a method for computing the cumulative distribution function of the cover time based on first-passage time statistics. Our method is viable for networks on which random walks equilibrate quickly. We show that it can be applied successfully to various model and real-world networks. Our results reveal an intimate link between first-passage and cover time statistics and offer a computationally efficient way for estimating cover times in network-related applications."

In numerical treatments, the long-range tails of the dyon fields cause severe finite-volume effects. Therefore, we demonstrate the application of Ewald\u2019s summation method to this system. Finite-volume effects are shown to be under control, which is a crucial requirement for numerical studies of interacting dyon ensembles."

To identify possible transmission routes, we applied combined genomics and contact-network modeling to retrospectively evaluate routine VRE screening data generated by the infection control program of a hemato-oncology unit. Over 1 year, a total of 111 VRE isolates from 111 patients were collected by anal swabs in a tertiary care hospital in Southern Germany. All isolated VRE were whole-genome sequenced, followed by different in-depth bioinformatics analyses including genotyping and determination of phylogenetic relations, aiming to evaluate a standardized workflow. Patient movement data were used to overlay sequencing data to infer transmission events and strain dynamics over time. A predominant clone harboring vanB and exhibiting genotype ST117/CT469 (n = 67) was identified. Our comprehensive combined analyses suggested intra-hospital spread, especially of clone ST117/CT469, despite of extensive screening, single room placement, and contact isolation. A new interactive tool to visualize these complex data was designed. Furthermore, a patient-contact network-modeling approach was developed, which indicates both the periodic import of the clone into the hospital and its spread within the hospital due to patient movements. The analyzed spread of VRE was most likely due to placement of patients in the same room prior to positivity of screening. We successfully demonstrated the added value for this combined strategy to extract well-founded knowledge from interdisciplinary data sources \u2026"

It is an important tool for exploring and finding patterns, and is used by researchers and practitioners across many fields and industries. Currently, there exist a number of tools for visualizing networks. Networkx (Hagberg, Schult, & Swart, 2008) is a popular Python package for network analysis which provides limited functionality for computing layouts and plotting networks statically. Layout computations are done in Python or using the php-based software Graphviz (Ellson, Gansner, Koutsofios, North, & Woodhull, 2002), which is slow. Another Python package for network analysis and visualization is graph-tool (Peixoto, 2014), which relies on a high number of external C++-libraries for installation/compilation which can be overwhelming for beginners. Furthermore, its visualization functions have limited interactive features. Gephi (Bastian, Heymann, & Jacomy, 2009) and Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) are dedicated interactive visualization and analysis software programs. They are both Javabased and run desktop clients with a GUI where users save and load networks as separate files. Webweb (Wapman & Larremore, 2019) enables interactive visualization for Python and Matlab networks using the d3. js (Bostock, Ogievetsky, & Heer, 2011) force layout. Its main purpose, however, is exploration of network features and exporting one-time visualizations as SVG or HTML.For many users, these tools offer the necessary functionality to visualize networks in most desired ways.

They are highly effective against infection and substantially reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. However, their potential for attenuating long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, commonly denoted as Long COVID, remains elusive and is still subject of debate. Such long-term effects can be effectively monitored at the individual level by analyzing physiological data collected by consumer-grade wearable sensors. Here, we investigate changes in resting heart rate, daily physical activity, and sleep duration in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by vaccination status. Data was collected over a period of two years in the context of the German Corona Data Donation Project with currently around 190,000 monthly active donors. Compared to their unvaccinated counterparts, we find that vaccinated individuals on average experience smaller changes in their vital data that also return to normal levels more quickly. Likewise, extreme changes in vitals during the acute phase of the disease occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals. Our results solidify evidence that vaccines can mitigate long-term detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections both in terms of duration and magnitude. Furthermore, they demonstrate the value of large scale, high-resolution wearable sensor data in public health research."

      "abstract": "Analyzing the spread of infectious diseases by means of compartmental mathematical models has been an active area of research for almost a century (Anderson & May, 2010; Keeling & Rohani, 2011; Kermack & McKendrick, 1991). Since the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in early 2020, the field has seen yet another considerable boost in interest. Researchers have since been working on a large number of different models that are used to forecast case numbers, to analyze the implications of different contact structures between individual people, or to discuss the influence of various mitigation and containment strategies, to only name a few applications (Estrada, 2020).The complexity of detailed epidemiological models often mitigates simple replication and/or adaptation to local circumstances. Typically, modifications are quickly thought up, but their influence on system properties such as the epidemic threshold or outbreak size are less clear. Variations in model formulation often entail the reimplementation of simulation and analysis frameworks for every model iteration, taking up valuable time and resources for debugging and reanalysis. Furthermore, researchers often need to cross-check their results by implementing both deterministic well-mixed models as well as models that consider explicit contact structures (ie, static or temporal networks). Last but not least, analytical derivations are often done using separate computer algebra systems."

      "abstract": "Vaccination against COVID-19 with the recently approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) is currently underway in a large number of countries. However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large \u2026"

      "abstract": "Digital contact tracing (DCT) applications have been introduced in many countries to aid the containment of COVID-19 outbreaks. Initially, enthusiasm was high regarding their implementation as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). However, no country was able to prevent larger outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs. Here, we discuss results of a stochastic infectious-disease model that provide insights in how the progression of an outbreak and key parameters such as detection probability, app participation and its distribution, as well as engagement of users impact DCT efficacy informed by results of empirical studies. We further show how contact heterogeneity and local contact clustering impact the intervention\u2019s efficacy. We conclude that DCT apps might have prevented cases on the order of single-digit percentages during single outbreaks for empirically plausible ranges of parameters, ignoring that a substantial part of these contacts would have been identified by manual contact tracing. This result is generally robust against changes in network topology with exceptions for homogeneous-degree, locally-clustered contact networks, on which the intervention prevents more infections. An improvement of efficacy is similarly observed when app participation is highly clustered. We find that DCT typically averts more cases during the super-critical phase of an epidemic when case counts are rising and the measured efficacy therefore depends on the time of evaluation."

      "abstract": "Human systems have been modeled and analyzed on the basis of complex networks theory in recent time. This abstraction allows for thorough quantitative analyses to investigate which structural and temporal features of a system influence the evolution of spreading processes, such as the passage of information or of infectious diseases. The first part of this work investigates how the ubiquitous modular hierarchical structure of static real-world networks allows for fast delivery of messages. New heuristics are developed to evaluate random walk mean first passage times and cover times on locally clustered networks. A comparison to average medium approximations shows that the emergence of these minima are pure network phenomena. It is further found that not all modular hierarchical network models provide optimal message delivery structure. In the second part, temporally varying face-to-face contact networks are investigated for their susceptibility to infection. Several studies have shown that people tend to spend time in small, densely-connected groups or in isolation, and that their connection behavior follows a circadian rhythm. To what extent both of these features influence the spread of diseases is as yet unclear. Therefore, a new temporal network model is devised here. Based on this model, circadially varying networks can for the first time be interpreted as following trajectories through a newly defined systemic state space. It is further revealed that in many temporally varying networks the system becomes less susceptible to infection when the time-scale of the disease approaches the time-scale of the network variation.

We revisit a MH network model that interpolates, using a single parameter, between two known network topologies: from strong hierarchical modularity to an Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random connectivity structure. We show that this model displays a similar small-world effect as the Kleinberg model, where the connection probability between nodes decays algebraically with distance.

Sustained community transmission favors the proliferation of mutated sub-lineages with pandemic potential, due to cross-national mobility flows, which are responsible for consecutive cases surge worldwide. We show that, in the early stages of an emerging variant, integrating data from national genomic surveillance and global human mobility with large-scale epidemic modeling allows to quantify its pandemic potential, providing quantifiable indicators for pro-active policy interventions. We validate our framework on worldwide spreading variants and gain insights about the pandemic potential of BA.5, BA.2.75 and other sub- and lineages. We combine the different sources of information in a simple estimate of the pandemic delay and show that only in combination, the pandemic potentials of the lineages are correctly assessed relative to each other. Country-level epidemic intelligence is not enough to contrast the pandemic of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and a scalable integrated approach, i.e. pandemic intelligence, is required to enhance global preparedness."

      "abstract": "We discuss a two-week summer course on \u201cNetwork Science\u201d and \u201cComplex Systems\u201d that we taught for 15 German high-school pupils of ages 16\u201318. In this course, we covered topics in graph theory, applied network science, programming, and dynamic systems alike. We find that \u201cNetwork Science\u201d is a well-suited course for introducing students to university-level mathematics. We reflect on difficulties regarding programming exercises and the discussion of more advanced topics in dynamic systems. We make the course material available and encourage fellow network scientists to organize similar outreach events."

      "abstract": "Thermophoresis is the process of particles moving along a temperature gradient in thermodynamic systems. Even though it has been studied for over 150 years, there is neither a complete theoretical description of thermophoresis in liquids nor of the Soret coefficient, the quantifiying measure of the Soret equilibrium. Recent studies connect its nature to equilibrium properties of the system, namely the excess enthalpy and the excess entropy, while there is still a debate over which of both describes the Soret coefficient more accurately and whether it can even be represented using those quantities. In this work I present a theoretical description for both cases based on density analysis by means of Brownian motion and dynamical density functional theory, where I assume local equilibrium. The interpretation of the Brownian stochastic differential equation (SDE) as an Ito or Stratonovich SDE is shown to have an influence on the outcome of the density. I argue that a Soret coefficient proportional to the excess enthalpy is connected to a system in a thermal gradient following its equation of state. Furthermore, I derive that the Boltzmann distribution law for external potentials does not hold for systems in thermal gradients but has to be replaced by a more general quantity. The theoretical predictions are consequently tested by means of BD simulations, where several systems are shown to follow their equation of state. The Soret coefficient of a solute in a toy model solvent is shown to be proportional to the solute's equilibrium solvation enthalpy. I further attempt to verify the theoretic derivations by means of MD simulations of noble gas solutes in SPC/E water \u2026"

      "abstract": "Disease propagation between countries strongly depends on their effective distance, a measure derived from the world air transportation network (WAN). It reduces the complex spreading patterns of a pandemic to a wave-like propagation from the outbreak country, i.e. a linear relationship to the arrival time of the unmitigated spread of a disease. However, in the early stage of an outbreak, what matters to countries' decision makers is knowledge about the relative risk of arrival of active cases, i.e. how likely it is that an active case that boarded at the outbreak location will arrive in their country. As accurate mechanistic models to estimate such risks are still lacking, we propose here the ``import risk'' model that defines an import probability by means of the effective-distance framework. The model assumes that airline passengers are distributed along the shortest path tree that starts at the outbreak's origin. In combination with a random walk, we account for all possible paths, thus inferring predominant connecting flights. Our model outperforms other mobility models, such as the radiation and gravity model with varying distance types, and it improves further if additional geographic information is included. The import risk model's precision increases for countries that are more connected within the WAN, and recovers a geographic distance-dependence that suggests a pull- rather than a push-dynamic of the distribution process."

      "abstract": "Dyonen sind Teilchen aus einem semiklassischen Zugang zur L\u00f6sung der SU(2) Yang-Mills Feldgleichungen bei endlicher Temperatur. In dieser Arbeit werden verschiedene Methoden verwendet, um Dyonen als Erzeuger von Confinement zu untersuchen. Zuerst werden analytische Ausdr\u00fccke f\u00fcr nichtwechselwirkende Dyonen numerisch ausgewertet, um den Polyakov-Loop-Korrelator zu berechnen und folglich die Freie Energie f\u00fcr ein statisches Quark-Antiquark-Paar zu erhalten. F\u00fcr diese wird ein lineares Verhalten bei steigendem Quarkabstand und damit Confinement beobachtet. Anschlie\u00dfend untersuche ich die sogenannte Ewaldsummation, eine Methode, mit der das Eichpotential einer Superposition von Dyonen numerisch effizient berechnet werden kann, was notwendig f\u00fcr die Auswertung des Polyakov-Loop-Korrelators ist. Die Ergebnisse zeigen eine \u00dcbereinstimmung mit den analytischen Resultaten, allerdings hat diese Methode den Vorteil, auch f\u00fcr wechselwirkende Dyonen Berechnungen zu erm\u00f6glichen. Im letzten Teil der Arbeit schlage ich eine Methode vor, wechselwirkende Dyonen zu untersuchen und beschreibe mithilfe der Ewaldsummation einen Metropolisalgorithmus um f\u00fcr diesen Fall valide Dyonkonfigurationen zu erzeugen."

To avoid such effects we apply the so-called Ewald method, which has its origin in solid state physics.

We show analytically, that the quark-antiquark free energy from the Polyakov loop correlator grows linearly with the distance, and how the string tension scales with the dyon density. In numerical treatments, the long-range tails of the dyon fields cause severe finite-volume effects. Therefore, we demonstrate the application of Ewald's summation method to this system. Finite-volume effects are shown to be under control, which is a crucial requirement for numerical studies of interacting dyon ensembles."
