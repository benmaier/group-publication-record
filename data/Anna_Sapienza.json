      "abstract": "We introduce a system for automatically generating warnings of imminent or current cyber-threats. Our system leverages the communication of malicious actors on the darkweb, as well as activity of cyber security experts on social media platforms like Twitter. In a time period between September, 2016 and January, 2017, our method generated 661 alerts of which about 84% were relevant to current or imminent cyber-threats. In the paper, we first illustrate the rationale and workflow of our system, then we measure its performance. Our analysis is enriched by two case studies: the first shows how the method could predict DDoS attacks, and how it would have allowed organizations to prepare for the Mirai attacks that caused widespread disruption in October 2016. Second, we discuss the method's timely identification of various instances of data breaches."

Recent attacks by WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware crypto-worms, infected hundreds of thousands of computer systems world wide, compromising data and critical infrastructure. In order to limit their impact, it is, therefore, critical to detect---and even predict---cyber attacks before they spread. Here, we introduce DISCOVER, an early cyber threat warning system, that mines online chatter from cyber actors on social media, security blogs, and darkweb forums, to identify words that signal potential cyber attacks. We evaluate DISCOVER and find that it can identify terms related to emerging cyber threats with precision above $80%$.

We hypothesized that streaming can act as a form of implicit incentive to boost players\u2019 performance and engagement. To test this hypothesis, we continuously collected data about all Twitch streams related to a popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, League of Legends (LoL), and data of all LoL matches played during the same time frame, and cross-mapped the two data sets. We found that, counterintuitively, streaming significantly deteriorates players\u2019 in-game performance: This may be due to the burden of carrying out two cognitively intensive activities at the same time, namely, playing the game and producing its commentary for streaming purposes. On the other hand, streaming increases engagement keeping players in significantly longer game sessions. We investigate these \u2026"

Our work examines data from a popular MOBA game, League of Legends, to understand the evolution of individual performance within ad hoc teams. Our analysis of player performance in successive matches of a gaming session demonstrates that a player\u2019s success deteriorates over the course of the session, but this effect is mitigated by the player\u2019s experience.

Due to their success, these games also drew the attention of our research community, because they provide a wealth of information about human online interactions and behaviors. A crucial problem is the extraction of activity patterns that characterize this type of data, in an interpretable way. Here, we leverage the Non-negative Tensor Factorization to detect hidden correlated behaviors of playing in a well-known game: League of Legends. To this aim, we collect the entire gaming history of a group of about 1000 players, which accounts for roughly 100K matches. By applying our framework we are able to separate players into different groups. We show that each group exhibits similar features and playing strategies, as well as similar temporal trajectories, i.e., behavioral progressions over the course of their gaming history. We surprisingly discover that playing strategies are stable over time and we provide an explanation for this observation."

      "abstract": "Cooperation is a fundamental social mechanism, whose effects on human performance have been investigated in several environments. Online games are modern-days natural settings in which cooperation strongly affects human behavior. Every day, millions of players connect and play together in team-based games: the patterns of cooperation can either foster or hinder individual skill learning and performance. This work has three goals: (i) identifying teammates' influence on players' performance in the short and long term, (ii) designing a computational framework to recommend teammates to improve players' performance, and (iii) setting to demonstrate that such improvements can be predicted via deep learning. We leverage a large dataset from Dota 2, a popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. We generate a directed co-play network, whose links' weights depict the effect of teammates on players' performance. Specifically, we propose a measure of network influence that captures skill transfer from player to player over time. We then use such framing to design a recommendation system to suggest new teammates based on a modified deep neural autoencoder and we demonstrate its state-of-the-art recommendation performance. We finally provide insights into skill transfer effects: our experimental results demonstrate that such dynamics can be predicted using deep neural networks."

Here we present an anomaly detection approach for temporal graph data, based on an iterative tensor decomposition and masking procedure. We test this approach using high-resolution social network data from wearable proximity sensors. The dataset includes metadata that allow to independently build a ground truth, used to validate the anomaly detection method. Our approach achieves high accuracy in identifying meso-scale network anomalies due to sensor wearing protocol, proving the practical viability of the method for a real-world application."

Balanced neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow depends on the retention-promoting chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 and the egression-promoting chemokine CXCL2 and its receptor CXCR2. Both pathways activate the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, leaving the role of this signaling event in neutrophil retention and egression ambiguous. On the assumption that active Rac determines persistent directional cell migration, we generated a mathematical model to link chemokine-mediated Rac modulation to neutrophil egression time. Our computer simulation indicated that, in the bone marrow, where the retention signal predominated, egression time strictly depended on the time it took Rac to return to its basal activity (namely, adaptation). This prediction was validated in mice \u2026"

While the structural and dynamical information revealed by this type of data is fundamental to investigate how information or diseases propagate in a population, data often suffer from incompleteness, which possibly leads to biased estimations in data-driven models. A major challenge is thus to estimate the outcome of spreading processes occurring on temporal networks built from partial information. To cope with this problem, we devise an approach based on non-negative tensor factorization, a dimensionality reduction technique from multilinear algebra. The key idea is to learn a low-dimensional representation of the temporal network built from partial information and to use it to construct a surrogate network similar to the \u2026"

Despite the massive amount of research studying the role of social ties in communities (groups, teams, etc.) and society at large, little attention has been devoted to study their interplay with other human behavioral dynamics. Of particular interest is the influence that social ties have on human performance in collaborative team-based settings. Our research aims to elucidate the influence of social ties on individual and team performance dynamics. We will focus on a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) collaborative team-based game,  Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2) , a rich data set with millions of players and matches.

The broadly most successful method of those tried sampled from a stationary probability distribution of actions and target repositories for each agent. First, we describe the agent-based simulator we developed to carry out massive-scale simulations of techno-social systems. Second, we present the inference methods that we employed to implement different agent-based models, based on statistical modeling of historical activity, graph embedding to infer future interactions, Bayesian models to capture activity processes, and methods to predict the emergence of new users and repositories that did not exist in the historical data. These are novel applications of existing analytical tools to derive agent models from available data.

We use linear mixed effects (LME) models to describe relationships between players' personality traits (measured by the Five Factor Model) and two major aspects of the game: the impersonated roles and in-game actions. On the one hand, we study relationships within the game environment by modeling role attributes from match behaviors and vice versa.

To test the impact of such events on medical resources, simulations can provide a safe, controlled setting while replicating the chaotic environment typical of an actual disaster. A standardized method to collect and analyze data from mass casualty exercises is needed to assess preparedness and performance of the health care staff involved.In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of using wearable proximity sensors to measure proximity events during an MCI simulation. In the first instance, our objective was to demonstrate how proximity sensors can collect spatial and temporal information about the interactions between medical staff and patients during an MCI exercise in a quasi-autonomous way. In addition, we assessed how the deployment of this technology could help improve future simulations by analyzing the flow of patients in the hospital.Data were obtained and collected through the deployment of wearable proximity sensors during an MCI functional exercise. The scenario included 2 areas: the accident site and the Advanced Medical Post, and the exercise lasted 3 hours. A total of 238 participants were involved in the exercise and classified in categories according to their role: 14 medical doctors, 16 nurses, 134 victims, 47 Emergency Medical Services staff members, and 27 health care assistants and other hospital support staff.

This brings forth new challenges for the identification and removal of temporal graph anomalies that entail complex correlations of topological features and activity patterns. Here we present an anomaly detection approach for temporal graph data based on an iterative tensor decomposition and masking procedure. We test this approach using highresolution social network data from wearable sensors and show that it successfully detects anomalies due to sensor wearing time protocols."

      "abstract": "We introduce a system for automatically generating warnings of imminent or current cyber-threats. Our system leverages the communication of malicious actors on the darkweb, as well as activity of cyber security experts on social media platforms like Twitter. In a time period between September, 2016 and January, 2017, our method generated 661 alerts of which about 84% were relevant to current or imminent cyber-threats. In the paper, we first illustrate the rationale and workflow of our system, then we measure its performance. Our analysis is enriched by three case studies: the first shows how the method could predict DDoS attacks, and how it would have allowed organizations to prepare for the Mirai attacks that caused widespread disruption in October 2016. Second, we discuss the method\u2019s timely identification of new malware and ransomware threats, focusing on gooligan and luabot. Concluding, we demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to timely detect various instances of data breaches."

      "abstract": "This document introduces further experimental results for the proposed dipm-SC method. First, we present our algorithm\u2019s performance on synthetically generated time series datasets. We show the superior performance of the method over other possible shape-based extensions. Next, we present another real-world use-case scenario for GitHub repository dataset. We show by clustering multidimensional time-series of popularity of GitHub repositories coupled with other GitHub specific activities, we uncover underlying bursty and steady patterns of popularity gain similar to what we present in the original paper for Twitter hashtag dataset."
