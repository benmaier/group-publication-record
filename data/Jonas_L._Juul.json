      "abstract": "Do some types of information spread faster, broader, or further than others? To understand how information diffusions differ, scholars compare structural properties of the paths taken by content as it spreads through a network, studying so-called cascades. Commonly studied cascade properties include the reach, depth, breadth, and speed of propagation. Drawing conclusions from statistical differences in these properties can be challenging, as many properties are dependent. In this work, we demonstrate the essentiality of controlling for cascade sizes when studying structural differences between collections of cascades. We first revisit two datasets from notable recent studies of online diffusion that reported content-specific differences in cascade topology: an exhaustive corpus of Twitter cascades for verified true- or false-news content by Vosoughi et al.

Assuming that this mutation occurs at a random node in the contact network, we calculate the distribution of the number of \u201cdescendants,\u201d d, downstream from the initial \u201cpatient zero\u201d mutant. We find that the tail of the distribution decays as d\u2212 2 for complete graphs, random graphs, small-world networks, networks with block-like structure, and other infinite-dimensional networks.

      "abstract": "Across the world, countries are fighting to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The backbone of the response is a test-trace-isolate strategy, where suspected infected get tested and isolated and possible secondary cases get traced, tested and isolated. Because more accurate tests often take longer to analyze, and the benefits of contact tracing are strengthened by rapid diagnosis, there exists a trade-off in test sensitivity and test waiting time in test-trace-isolate strategies. Here we ask: How many false negatives can be tolerated in a rapid test so that it reduces transmission better than a slower, more accurate test? How does this change with contact tracing efficiency and test waiting time? We find that a rapid, less sensitive test performs best for many test-parameter choices and that this is true even for modest contact tracing efficiency. For COVID-19-like viral parameters, a test with 40% false negatives and immediate result might reduce transmission as well as a test with no false negatives and a 3-day waiting time. Our analysis suggests employing rapid tests to reduce test waiting times as a viable strategy to reduce transmission when testing infrastructure is under stress."

The internal clock in each cell is based on a negative feedback loop which couples to the clocks of neighboring cells through a Notch mechanism. We investigate how a morphogen gradient in the mesoderm, which affects the period of oscillating cells, gives rise to phase waves traveling from the posterior to the anterior part of the PSM. We show that the phase waves can be entrained by an external periodic variation in this morphogen and also observe that multiple oscillatory solutions can coexist in the cell population. Together, these provide a way to potentially control phase waves and thereby manipulate somite patterning in embryos, based on entrainment properties of coupled nonlinear oscillators."

Depending on the project and external circumstances, a newly formed collaboration may include people that have collaborated before in the past, and people with no collaboration history. Such existing relationships between team members have been reported to influence the performance of teams. However, it is not clear how existing relationships between team members should be quantified, and whether some relationships are more likely to occur in new collaborations than others. Here we introduce a new family of structural patterns, m-patterns, which formalize relationships between collaborators and we study the prevalence of such structures in data and a simple random-hypergraph null model. We analyze the frequency with which different collaboration structures appear in our null model and show how such frequencies depend on size and hyperedge density in the hypergraphs. Comparing the null model to data of human and non-human collaborations, we find that some collaboration structures are vastly under- and overrepresented in empirical datasets. Finally, we find that structures of scientific collaborations on COVID-19 papers in some cases are statistically significantly different from those of non-COVID-19 papers. Examining citation counts for 4 different scientific fields, we also find indications that repeat collaborations are more successful for 2-author scientific publications and less successful for 3-author scientific publications as compared to other collaboration structures."

      "abstract": "The outcome of an election depends not only on which candidate is more popular, but also on how many of their voters actually turn out to vote. Here we consider a simple model in which voters abstain from voting if they think their vote would not matter. Specifically, they do not vote if they feel sure their preferred candidate will win anyway (a condition we call complacency), or if they feel sure their candidate will lose anyway (a condition we call dejectedness). The voters reach these decisions based on a myopic assessment of their local network, which they take as a proxy for the entire electorate: voters know which candidate their neighbors prefer and they assume\u2014perhaps incorrectly\u2014that those neighbors will turn out to vote, so they themselves cast a vote if and only if it would produce a tie or a win for their preferred candidate in their local neighborhood.

      "abstract": "Tracing potentially infected contacts of confirmed cases is important when fighting outbreaks of many infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated researchers to examine how different contact tracing strategies compare in terms of effectiveness (ability to mitigate infections) and cost efficiency (number of prevented infections per isolation). Two important strategies are so-called forward contact tracing (tracing to whom disease spreads) and backward contact tracing (tracing from whom disease spreads). Recently, Kojaku and colleagues reported that backward contact tracing was ``profoundly more effective'' than forward contact tracing, that contact tracing effectiveness ``hinges on reaching the `source' of infection'', and that contact tracing outperformed case isolation in terms of cost efficiency. Here we show that these conclusions are not true in general. They were based in part on simulations that vastly overestimated the effectiveness and efficiency of contact tracing. Our results show that the efficiency of contact tracing strategies is highly contextual; faced with a disease outbreak, the disease dynamics determine whether tracing infection sources or new cases is more impactful. Our results also demonstrate the importance of simulating disease spread and mitigation measures in parallel rather than sequentially."

Ripe with personal anecdotes, historical context, and small mathematical examples, the journey touches on everything from communicable diseases to the stock market, online propagation of memes, and the social contagion of crime. At the end of this journey, the reader is left with a sense of both similarities and differences between contagions in these different realms.The text is aimed at a general nonscientific audience, but the scope is broad enough that professionals might also find it enlightening\u2014especially since a large fraction of working scientists have become epidemiologists (armchair or otherwise) during the Covid-19 pandemic. The beginning of the book is just excellent. Kucharski begins his text by introducing fundamental epidemiological concepts in the \u2026"

      "abstract": "Nothing in our universe is completely isolated; everything is connected. For the past three years, I have had the great privilege of exploring many wonders of our connected world. The projects I have worked on deal with interacting systems of very different nature: From particular processes carried out by stem cells in developmental biology, to idealised contagion in abstract models of connected individuals. The projects also make use of very different methods. In some cases, I seek to answer questions using calculations and simulations. Other projects are entirely data-driven.The diversity in projects is partially due to this work being funded by three different grants. The grants had very different scopes, and each provided one-third of the funding of this doctoral work. But the heterogeneity in topics also illustrates the fantastic importance of understanding how interactions of individual agents shape the world around us. Interactions are simply present in systems of all scales; big or small; biological, engineered, or social. Some interactions are of great importance, while others are nothing but noise."
