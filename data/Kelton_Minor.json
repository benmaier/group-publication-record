We use mixed effects models to examine age-related trends in naturalistic sleep patterns and assess gender and BMI differences in these trends while controlling for user and country-level variation.Our results confirm that sleep duration decreases, the prevalence of nighttime awakenings increases, while sleep onset and offset advance to become earlier \u2026"

Yet it remains unclear whether warmer-than-average temperatures causally impact objective measures of sleep globally. Here, we link billions of repeated sleep measurements from sleep-tracking wristbands comprising over 7 million sleep records (n = 47,628) across 68 countries to local daily meteorological data. Controlling for individual, seasonal, and time-varying confounds, increased temperature shortens sleep primarily through delayed onset, increasing the probability of insufficient sleep. The temperature effect on sleep loss is substantially larger for residents from lower-income countries and older adults, and females are affected more than males. Those in hotter regions experience comparably more sleep loss per degree of warming \u2026"

      "abstract": "Understanding which transportation modes people use is critical for smart cities and planners to better serve their citizens. We show that using information from pervasive Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices can enhance GPS and geographic information to improve transportation detection on smartphones. Wi-Fi information also improves the identification of transportation mode and helps conserve battery since it is already collected by most mobile phones. Our approach uses a machine learning approach to determine the mode from pre-prepocessed data. This approach yields an overall accuracy of 89% and average F1 score of 83% for inferring the three grouped modes of self-powered, car-based, and public transportation. When broken out by individual modes, Wi-Fi features improve detection accuracy of bus trips, train travel, and driving compared to GPS features alone and can substitute for GIS features without decreasing performance. Our results suggest that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be useful in urban transportation research, for example by improving mobile travel surveys and urban sensing applications."

      "abstract": "This section offers a series of joint reflections on (open) data platform from a variety of cases, from cycling, traffic and mapping to activism, environment and data brokering. Data platforms play a key role in contemporary urban governance. Linked to open data initiatives, such platforms are often proposed as both mechanisms for enhancing the accountability of administrations and performing as sites for'bottom-up'digital invention. Such promises of smooth flows of data, however, rarely materialise unproblematically. The development of data platforms is always situated in legal and administrative cultures, databases are often built according to the standards of existing digital ecologies, access always involves processes of social negotiation, and interfaces (such as sensors) may become objects of public contestation. The following contributions explore the contested and mutable character of open data platforms as part of heterogeneous publics and trace the pathways of data through different knowledge, skills, public and private configurations. They also reflect on the value of STS approaches to highlight issues and tensions as well as to shape design and governance."

Relative to other topics, however, it is also one of the impacts that thus far has been understudied. 1 Much of the literature related to climate change and mental health draws on previous bodies of work from clinical psychiatry and clinical psychology that show the direct toll of exposure to environmental stressors2 on mental well-being and examines what these relationships can tell us about the risk of future climatic changes. 3 And most empirical studies that do exist focus on data from local or regional contexts. Relatively few national\u2014and even fewer global\u2014investigations of the potential of climate change to impact mental health exist. It is this relative gap \u2026"

Here we conduct a nationally representative survey (N\u2009=\u2009939) of Kalaallit (Greenlanders\u2019) views on glacially derived sand extraction, finding that large majorities support extracting and exporting sand but oppose foreign involvement. This pattern of support persists at both the national and subnational levels. Public preferences largely align with Kalaallit Nunaat\u2019s current mineral policy mandating environmental and economic impact assessments of new resource opportunities.

These pathways could operate independently, additively, interactively, and cumulatively to increase substance-use vulnerability.

      "abstract": "Earlier reviews documented the effects of a broad range of climate change outcomes on sleep but have not yet evaluated the effect of ambient temperature. This systematic review aims to identify and summarize the literature on ambient temperature and sleep outcomes in a warming world.For this systematic review, we searched online databases (PubMed, Scopus, JSTOR, GreenFILE, GeoRef and PsycARTICLES) together with relevant journals for studies published before February 2023. We included articles reporting associations between objective indicators of ambient temperature and valid sleep outcomes measured in real-life environments. We included studies conducted among adults, adolescents, and children. A narrative synthesis of the literature was then performed.The present systematic review shows that higher outdoor or indoor ambient temperatures, expressed either as daily mean or night-time temperature, are negatively associated with sleep quality and quantity worldwide. The negative effect of higher ambient temperatures on sleep is stronger in the warmest months of the year, among vulnerable populations and in the warmest areas of the world. This result appears consistent across several sleep indicators and measures.Although this work identified several methodological limitations of the extant literature, a strong body of evidence from both this systematic review and previous experimental studies converge on the negative impact of elevated temperatures on sleep quality and quantity. In absence of solid evidence on fast adaptation to the effects of heat on sleep, rising \u2026"

      "abstract": "Humanity spends an increasing proportion of its time interacting online. Scholars are intensively investigating the societal drivers and resultant impacts of this collective shift in our allocation of time and attention. Yet, the external factors that regularly shape online behavior remain markedly understudied. Do environmental factors alter rates of online activity? Here we show that adverse meteorological conditions markedly increase social media use in the United States. To do so, we employ climate econometric methods alongside over three and a half billion social media posts from tens of millions of individuals from both Facebook and Twitter between 2009 and 2016. We find that more extreme temperatures and added precipitation each independently amplify social media activity. Weather that is adverse on both the temperature and precipitation dimensions produces markedly larger increases in social media activity. On average across both platforms, compared to the temperate weather baseline, days colder than -5{\\deg}C with 1.5-2cm of precipitation elevate social media activity by 35%. This effect is nearly three times the typical increase in social media activity observed on New Year's Eve in New York City. We observe meteorological effects on social media participation at both the aggregate and individual level, even accounting for individual-specific, temporal, and location-specific potential confounds."

Although Greenland is a hub for climate science, the climate perceptions of Greenland\u2019s predominantly Indigenous population remained unstudied through the past decade of multi-national climate opinion polls. Conducting two original nationally representative surveys, here we show that Greenlanders are more likely than residents of top oil-producing Arctic countries to perceive that climate change is happening, and about twice as likely to have personally experienced its effects. However, half are unaware that climate change is human-caused, and those who are most affected appear to be least aware. An Inuit cultural dimension, indicated by the intertwined social ecological factors of Indigenous identity, subsistence occupation, village community scale and no post-elementary education, proves to be the main positive predictor of climate change experience but also the strongest negative predictor of awareness of human-caused climate change. Despite Greenland\u2019s centrality to climate research, we uncover a widespread gap between the scientific consensus and coastal Kalaallit views of climate change, particularly among the country\u2019s youth, fishers, and hunters. This sciencesociety gulf has immediate and prospective implications for local climate adaptation, climate science communication and knowledge exchange between generations, institutions, and communities."
