      "abstract": "Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society,,. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities,: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes, or social spheres,,. Communities in networks often overlap, such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure,,. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent \u2026"

However, despite the enormous potential presented by this remarkable data source, we still do not have an understanding of the Twitter population itself: Who are the Twitter users? How representative of the overall population are they? In this paper, we take the first steps towards answering these questions by analyzing data on a set of Twitter users representing over 1% of the US population. We develop techniques that allow us to compare the Twitter population to the US population along three axes (geography, gender, and race/ethnicity), and find that the Twitter population is a highly non-uniform sample of the population."

In social media sentiment analysis and related tasks, researchers have therefore used binarized emoticons and specific hashtags as forms of distant supervision. Our paper shows that by extending the distant supervision to a more diverse set of noisy labels, the models can learn richer representations. Through emoji prediction on a dataset of 1246 million tweets containing one of 64 common emojis we obtain state-of-the-art performance on 8 benchmark datasets within sentiment, emotion and sarcasm detection using a single pretrained model. Our analyses confirm that the diversity of our emotional labels yield a performance improvement over previous distant supervision approaches."

Nonpharmaceutical interventions have proven to be critical for delaying and containing the COVID-19 pandemic (2\u20136). These include testing and tracing, bans on large gatherings, nonessential business and school and university closures, international and domestic mobility restrictions and physical isolation, and total lockdowns of regions and countries. Decision-making and evaluation or such interventions during all stages of the pandemic life cycle require specific, reliable, and timely data not only about infections but also about human behavior, especially mobility and physical copresence.

      "abstract": "It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using \u2018social bots\u2019 deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques."

In longitudinal datasets across various domains, covering multiple decades, we find increasing gradients and shortened periods in the trajectories of how cultural items receive collective attention. Is this the inevitable conclusion of the way information is disseminated and consumed? Our findings support this hypothesis. Using a simple mathematical model of topics competing for finite collective attention, we are able to explain the empirical data remarkably well. Our modeling suggests that the accelerating ups and downs of popular content are driven by increasing production and consumption of content, resulting in a more rapid exhaustion of limited attention resources. In the interplay with competition for novelty, this causes \u2026"

The probability that a given paper in the SPIRES database has k citations is well described by simple power laws, P (k)\u221d k\u2212 \u03b1, with \u03b1\u2248 1.2 for k less than 50 citations and \u03b1\u2248 2.3 for 50 or more citations. A consideration of citation distribution by subfield shows that the citation patterns of high energy physics form a remarkably homogeneous network. Further, we utilize the knowledge of the citation distributions to demonstrate the extreme improbability that the citation records of selected individuals and institutions have been obtained by a random draw on the resulting distribution."

Based on an extension of the k-clique community detection algorithm, we demonstrate how modular structure in bipartite networks presents itself as overlapping bicliques. If bipartite information is available, the biclique community detection algorithm retains all of the advantages of the k-clique algorithm, but avoids discarding important structural information when performing a one-mode projection of the network. Further, the biclique community detection algorithm provides a level of flexibility by incorporating independent clique thresholds for each of the nonoverlapping node sets in the bipartite network."

A concurrent study has emphasized the explorative nature of human behaviour, showing that the number of visited places grows steadily over time\u2013. How to reconcile these seemingly contradicting facts remains an open question. Here, we analyse high-resolution multi-year traces of ~40,000 individuals from 4 datasets and show that this tension vanishes when the long-term evolution of mobility patterns is considered. We reveal that mobility patterns evolve significantly yet smoothly, and that the number of familiar locations an individual visits at any point is a conserved quantity with a typical size of ~25. We use this finding to improve state-of-the-art modelling of human mobility,. Furthermore, shifting the attention from aggregated quantities to individual behaviour, we show that the size \u2026"

In fact, due to inherent stability and low entropy of human mobility, it is possible to assign location to WiFi access points based on a very small number of GPS samples and then use these access points as location beacons. Using just one GPS observation per day per person allows us to estimate the location of, and subsequently use, WiFi access points to account for 80% of mobility across a population. These results reveal a great opportunity for using ubiquitous WiFi routers for high-resolution outdoor positioning, but also significant privacy implications of such side-channel location tracking."

Existing research indicates that class attendance is a useful predictor of subsequent course achievements. The majority of the literature is, however, based on surveys and self-reports, methods which have well-known systematic biases that lead to limitations on conclusions and generalizability as well as being costly to implement. Here we propose a novel method for measuring class attendance that overcomes these limitations by using location and bluetooth data collected from smartphone sensors. Based on measured attendance data of nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, we demonstrate that early and consistent class attendance strongly correlates with academic performance. In addition, our novel dataset allows us to determine that attendance among social peers was substantially correlated (>0.5), suggesting either an important peer effect or homophily with respect to attendance."

We show that, while an assigned team's performance is strongly correlated with its networks of expressive and instrumental ties, only the strongest ties in both networks have an effect on performance. Both networks of strong ties explain more of the variance than other factors, such as measured or self-evaluated technical competencies, or the personalities of the team members.

Using a Twitter-specific sentiment extraction methodology, we the explore patterns of sentiment present in a corpus of over 1.5 billion tweets. We focus primarily on the effect of the weather and time on aggregate sentiment, evaluating how clearly the well-known individual patterns translate into population-wide patterns. Using machine learning techniques on the Twitter corpus correlated with the weather at the time and location of the tweets, we find that aggregate sentiment follows distinct climate, temporal, and seasonal patterns."

The identification of high order structures in networks unveils insights into their functional organization.

There, human mobility is described as scale free\u2013. On the other hand, geographically, the concept of scale\u2014referring to meaningful levels of description from individual buildings to neighbourhoods, cities, regions and countries\u2014is central for the description of various aspects of human behaviour, such as socioeconomic interactions, or political and cultural dynamics,.

The predictive performance of models in literature varies quite broadly, from over 90% to under 40%. In this work we study which underlying factors - in terms of modeling approaches and spatio-temporal characteristics of the data sources - have resulted in this remarkably broad span of performance reported in the literature. Specifically we investigate which factors influence the accuracy of next-place prediction, using a high-precision location dataset of more than 400 users observed for periods between 3 months and one year. We show that it is much easier to achieve high accuracy when predicting the time-bin location than when predicting the next place. Moreover, we demonstrate how the temporal and spatial resolution of the data have strong \u2026"

Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538 undergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of individual and social characteristics.

Datasets that capture this specific aspect of human life have increased in size and availability over the last few years. We have yet to understand, however, to what extent such electronic datasets may serve as a valid proxy for real life social interactions. For an observational dataset, gathered using mobile phones, we analyze the problem of identifying transient and non-important links, as well as how to highlight important social interactions. Applying the Bluetooth signal strength parameter to distinguish between observations, we demonstrate that weak links, compared to strong links, have a lower probability of being observed at later times, while such links\u2014on average\u2014also have lower link-weights and probability of sharing an online friendship. Further, the role of link-strength is investigated in relation to social network properties."

Targeted measures such as case isolation and contact tracing can alleviate the societal cost of lock-downs by containing the spread where and when it occurs. To assess the relative and combined impact of manual contact tracing (MCT) and digital (app-based) contact tracing, we feed a compartmental model for COVID-19 with high-resolution datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts. We show that the benefit (epidemic size reduction) is generically linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The cost (number of quarantines) versus benefit curve has a characteristic parabolic shape, independent of the type of tracing, with a potentially high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are \u2026"

Until now, however, limited data resolution and coverage have hindered a coherent description of human displacements across different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we characterise mobility behaviour across several orders of magnitude by analysing \u223c850 individuals\u2019 digital traces sampled every \u223c16 seconds for 25 months with \u223c10 meters spatial resolution. We show that the distributions of distances and waiting times between consecutive locations are best described by log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and that natural time-scales emerge from the regularity of human mobility. We point out that log-normal distributions also characterise the patterns of discovery of new places, implying that they are not a simple consequence of the routine of modern life."

For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries.

We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens\u2019\u201cpersonal data stores\u201d, to be shared separately and selectively (eg, with a backend system \u2026"

We construct a bipartite network, and from it, overlapping cliques of densely connected articles and editors. We cluster these densely connected cliques into larger modules to study examples of larger groups that display how volunteer editors flock around articles driven by interest, real-world controversies, or the result of coordination in WikiProjects. Our results confirm that topics aggregate editors; and show that highly coordinated efforts result in dense clusters."

Because we have evolved to function with this cycle, the circadian rhythm is deeply ingrained and even detectable at the biochemical level. However, within the broader day-night pattern, there are individual differences: e.g., some of us are intrinsically morning-active, while others prefer evenings. In this article, we look at digital daily cycles: circadian patterns of activity viewed through the lens of auto-recorded data of communication and online activity. We begin at the aggregate level, discuss earlier results, and illustrate differences between population-level daily rhythms in different media. Then we move on to the individual level, and show that there is a strong individual-level variation beyond averages: individuals typically have their distinctive daily pattern that persists in time. We conclude by discussing the driving forces behind these signature daily patterns, from personal traits (morningness/eveningness) to variation in activity level and external constraints, and outline possibilities for future research."

The model is fitted to more than 400 participants from two different datasets, and we verify the results against ground truth from dedicated armband sleep trackers. We show that the model is able to produce reliable sleep estimates with an accuracy of 0.89, both at the individual and at the collective level. Moreover the Bayesian model is able to quantify uncertainty and encode prior knowledge about sleep patterns. Compared with existing smartphone-based systems, our method requires only screen on/off events, and is therefore much less intrusive in terms of privacy and more battery-efficient."

It is well established that a person\u2019s chronotype can affect their activities and health. However, less is known about the effects of chronotypes on social behavior, even though many social interactions require coordinated timings. To study how chronotypes relate to social behavior, we use data collected with a smartphone app on a population of more than seven hundred volunteer students to simultaneously determine their chronotypes and social network structure.

      "abstract": "Many real-world networks represent dynamic systems with interactions that change over time, often in uncoordinated ways and at irregular intervals. For example, university students connect in intermittent groups that repeatedly form and dissolve based on multiple factors, including their lectures, interests, and friends. Such dynamic systems can be represented as multilayer networks where each layer represents a snapshot of the temporal network. In this representation, it is crucial that the links between layers accurately capture real dependencies between those layers. Often, however, these dependencies are unknown. Therefore, current methods connect layers based on simplistic assumptions that do not capture node-level layer dependencies. For example, connecting every node to itself in other layers with the same weight can wipe out dependencies between intermittent groups, making it difficult or even \u2026"

Basic demographic information is however often absent from mobile phone datasets, limiting the operational impact of the datasets. For these reasons, there has been a growing interest in predicting demographic information from mobile phone metadata. Previous work focused on creating increasingly advanced features to be modeled with standard machine learning algorithms. We here instead model the raw mobile phone metadata directly using deep learning, exploiting the temporal nature of the patterns in the data. From high-level assumptions we design a data representation and convolutional network architecture for modeling patterns within a week. We then examine three strategies for aggregating patterns across weeks and show that our method reaches state-of-the-art \u2026"

Although gender differentiation has been observed in a number of settings, the majority of studies focus on a single data stream in isolation. Here we use a dataset of high resolution data collected using mobile phones, as well as detailed questionnaires, to study gender differences in a large cohort. We consider mobility behavior and individual personality traits among a group of more than 800 university students. We also investigate interactions among them expressed via person-to-person contacts, interactions on online social networks, and telecommunication. Thus, we are able to study the differences between male and female behavior captured through a multitude of channels for a single cohort. We find that while the two genders are similar in a number of aspects, there are robust deviations that include multiple facets of social interactions, suggesting the existence of inherent behavioral differences. Finally, we quantify how aspects of an individual\u2019s characteristics and social behavior reveals their gender by posing it as a classification problem. We ask: How well can we distinguish between male and female study participants based on behavior alone? Which behavioral features are most predictive?"

This model provides an excellent description of the citation distributions for live and dead papers in the SPIRES database. Further, this model suggests a novel and general mechanism for the generation of power law distributions in networks whenever the fraction of active nodes is small."

Here we focus on a different dimension: rather than the strength of links, we study physical distance between individuals when a link is activated. The findings presented here are based on a dataset of proximity events in a population of approximately 500 individuals. To quantify the impact of the physical proximity on the dynamic network, we use a simulated epidemic spreading processes in two distinct networks of physical proximity.

      "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy is currently recognized by the WHO as a major threat to global health. Recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in the role of social media in the propagation of false information and fringe narratives regarding vaccination. Using a sample of approximately 60 billion tweets, we conduct a large-scale analysis of the vaccine discourse on Twitter. We use methods from deep learning and transfer learning to estimate the vaccine sentiments expressed in tweets, then categorize individual-level user attitude towards vaccines. Drawing on an interaction graph representing mutual interactions between users, we analyze the interplay between vaccine stances, interaction network, and the information sources shared by users in vaccine-related contexts. We find that strongly anti-vaccine users frequently share content from sources of a commercial nature; typically sources which sell alternative health products for profit. An interesting aspect of this finding is that concerns regarding commercial conflicts of interests are often cited as one of the major factors in vaccine hesitancy. Further, we show that the debate is highly polarized, in the sense that users with similar stances on vaccination interact preferentially with one another. Extending this insight, we provide evidence of an epistemic echo chamber effect, where users are exposed to highly dissimilar sources of vaccine information, depending the vaccination stance of their contacts. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing vaccine mis- and dis-information in the context in which they are disseminated in social networks."

A critical property of a network is its resilience to random breakdown and failure (Albert et al., 2000; Cohen et al., 2000; Callaway et al., 2000; Cohen et al., 2001), typically studied as a percolation problem (Stauffer & Aharony, 1994; Achlioptas et al., 2009; Chen & D'Souza, 2011) or by modeling cascading failures (Motter, 2004; Buldyrev et al., 2010; Brummitt, et al. 2012). Many complex systems, from power grids and the Internet to the brain and society (Colizza et al., 2007; Vespignani, 2011; Balcan & Vespignani, 2011), can be modeled using modular networks comprised of small, densely connected groups of nodes (Girvan & Newman, 2002). These modules often overlap, with network elements belonging to multiple modules (Palla et al. 2005; Ahn et al. 2010). Yet \u2026"

      "abstract": "The weight of links in a network is often related to the similarity of the nodes. Here, we introduce a simple tunable measure for analysing the similarity of nodes across different link weights. In particular, we use the measure to analyze homophily in a group of 659 freshman students at a large university. Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom data collection software, complemented by questionnaire-based data. The network of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face contacts. We find that even strongly connected individuals are not more similar with respect to basic personality traits than randomly chosen pairs of individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels of acquaintanceships."

Here, we link billions of repeated sleep measurements from sleep-tracking wristbands comprising over 7 million sleep records (n = 47,628) across 68 countries to local daily meteorological data. Controlling for individual, seasonal, and time-varying confounds, increased temperature shortens sleep primarily through delayed onset, increasing the probability of insufficient sleep. The temperature effect on sleep loss is substantially larger for residents from lower-income countries and older adults, and females are affected more than males. Those in hotter regions experience comparably more sleep loss per degree of warming \u2026"

      "abstract": "In recent years, the amount of information collected about human beings has increased dramatically. This development has been partially driven by individuals posting and storing data about themselves and friends using online social networks or collecting their data for self-tracking purposes (quantified-self movement). Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies collecting data with an unprecedented resolution and scale. Using computational power combined with mathematical models, such rich datasets can be mined to infer underlying patterns, thereby providing insights into human nature. Much of the data collected is sensitive. It is private in the sense that most individuals would feel uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data publicly. For this reason, the need for solutions to ensure the privacy of the individuals generating data has grown alongside the data collection efforts. Out of all the massive data collection efforts, this paper focuses on efforts directly instrumenting human behavior, and notes that -- in many cases -- the privacy of participants is not sufficiently addressed. For example, study purposes are often not explicit, informed consent is ill-defined, and security and sharing protocols are only partially disclosed. This paper provides a survey of the work related to addressing privacy issues in research studies that collect detailed sensor data on human behavior. Reflections on the key problems and recommendations for future work are included. We hope the overview of the privacy-related practices in massive data collection studies can be used as a frame of reference for practitioners in the field. Although focused on data \u2026"

Smartphone sensing data is emerging as a promising source for studying human mobility.

In this paper we study the feasibility of inferring human mobility from sparse, low accuracy mobile sensing data. We validate our results using participants' location diaries, and analyze the inferred geographical networks, the time spent at different places, and the number of unique places over time. Our results suggest that low resolution data allows accurate inference of human mobility patterns."

In terms of understanding these patterns, the process of converting raw data into series of stop-locations and transitions is an important first step which greatly reduces the volume of data, thus simplifying the subsequent analyses. Previous research into the mobility of individuals has focused on inferring \u2018stop locations\u2019 (places of stationarity) from GPS or CDR data, or on detection of state (static/active). In this paper we bridge the gap between the two approaches: we introduce methods for detecting both mobility state and stop-locations. In addition, our methods are based exclusively on WiFi data. We study two months of WiFi data collected every two minutes by a smartphone, and infer stop-locations in the form of labelled time-intervals. For this purpose, we investigate two algorithms, both of which scale to large datasets: a greedy approach to select the most important routers and one which uses a density-based clustering algorithm to detect router fingerprints. We validate our results using participants\u2019 GPS data as well as ground truth data collected during a two month period."

To analyse this interplay, we model a large-scale design process of a biomass power plant with activities as a bipartite network.

We show that using information from pervasive Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices can enhance GPS and geographic information to improve transportation detection on smartphones. Wi-Fi information also improves the identification of transportation mode and helps conserve battery since it is already collected by most mobile phones. Our approach uses a machine learning approach to determine the mode from pre-prepocessed data. This approach yields an overall accuracy of 89% and average F1 score of 83% for inferring the three grouped modes of self-powered, car-based, and public transportation. When broken out by individual modes, Wi-Fi features improve detection accuracy of bus trips, train travel, and driving compared to GPS features alone and can substitute for GIS features without decreasing performance. Our results suggest that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be useful in urban transportation research, for example by improving mobile travel surveys and urban sensing applications."

      "abstract": "Travel restrictions have proven to be an effective strategy to control the spread of the COVID-19 epidemics, in part because they help delay disease propagation across territories. The question, however, as to how different types of travel behaviour, from commuting to holiday-related travel, contribute to the spread of infectious diseases remains open. Here, we address this issue by using factorization techniques to decompose the temporal network describing mobility flows throughout 2020 into interpretable components. Our results are based on two mobility datasets: the first is gathered from Danish mobile network operators; the second originates from the Facebook Data-For-Good project. We find that mobility patterns can be described as the aggregation of three mobility network components roughly corresponding to travel during workdays, weekends and holidays, respectively. We show that, across datasets, in \u2026"

If interruption of disease transmission is the goal, targeting requires knowledge of underlying person-to-person contact networks. Digital communication networks may reflect not only virtual but also physical interactions that could result in disease transmission, but the precise overlap between these cyber and physical networks has never been empirically explored in real-life settings. Here, we study the digital communication activity of more than 500 individuals along with their person-to-person contacts at a 5-min temporal resolution. We then simulate different disease transmission scenarios on the person-to-person physical contact \u2026"

As we study these datasets, human social interactions display patterns that emerge at multiple time scales, from minutes to months. On a fundamental level, understanding of the network dynamics can be used to inform the process of measuring social networks. The details of measurement are of particular importance when considering dynamic processes where minute-to-minute details are important, because collection of physical proximity interactions with high temporal resolution is difficult and expensive. Here, we consider the dynamic network of proximity-interactions between approximately 500 individuals participating in the Copenhagen Networks Study. We show that in order to accurately model spreading processes in the network, the dynamic processes that occur on the order of minutes \u2026"

The framework originates from the (new) observation that there is a meaningful division of temporal communication networks into six dynamic classes, where the class of a network is determined by its generating process. In particular, each class is characterized by a fundamental structure: a temporal-topological network motif, which corresponds to the network representation of communication events in that class of network. These fundamental structures constrain network configurations: only certain configurations are possible within a dynamic class. In this way the framework presented here highlights strong constraints on network structures, which simplify analyses and shape network flows. Therefore the fundamental structures hold the potential to impact how we \u2026"

Going beyond diurnal cycles, a central question is: to what extent do individuals act according to patterns shared across an entire population? Here we investigate the interplay between different activity types, namely communication, motion, and physical proximity by analyzing data collected from smartphones distributed among 638 individuals. We explore two central questions: Which underlying principles govern the formation of the activity patterns? Are the patterns specific to each individual or shared across the entire population? We find that statistics of the entire population allows us to successfully predict 71% of the activity and 85% of the inactivity involved in communication, mobility, and physical proximity. Surprisingly, individual level statistics only result in marginally better predictions, indicating that a majority of activity patterns are shared across our sample population. Finally, we predict short-term activity patterns using a generalized linear model, which suggests that a simple linear description might be sufficient to explain a wide range of actions, whether they be of social or of physical character."

We develop an analytically soluble growing network model incorporating this distinction and show that it can provide a quantitative description of the empirical network composed of citations and references (in- and out-links) between papers (nodes) in the SPIRES database of scientific papers in high energy physics. We also demonstrate that the death mechanism alone can result in power law degree distributions for the resulting network."

Although it is known that the network of physical contacts, for example, is distinct from the network arising from communication events via phone calls and instant messages, the extent to which these networks differ is not clear. We show here that the network structure of these channels show large structural variations. The various channels account for diverse relationships between pairs of individuals and the corresponding interaction patterns across channels differ to an extent that social ties cannot easily be reduced to a single layer.

Furthermore, the increasing amount of data produced and stored by companies leaves traces and enables the application of data science to learn from past design processes. In this article, we analyse a document-log to show the temporal evolution of a real design process of a power plant by using exploratory data analysis and network analysis. We show how the iterative nature of the design process is reflected in archival data and how one might re-construct the design process, involving iterations between many parties, including the client, external consultants, suppliers, and designers. We also show how people use different representations during the design process and how this is associated with a design phase-transition in the process. Finally, we relate our findings with the literature on iterations and discuss implications for research and practice with application to project management and process modelling."

How can we extract more information from limited datasets? How can we take individual cognition and decision-making processes into account? How can we incorporate other complexity of the real contagion processes? Finally, how can we translate research into positive real-world impact?

Sharing such data, however, can lead to serious privacy issues, because individuals could be re-identified, not only based on possible nodes\u2019 attributes, but also from the structure of the network around them. The risk associated with re-identification can be measured and it is more serious in some networks than in others. While various optimization algorithms have been proposed to anonymize networks, there is still only a limited theoretical understanding of which network features are important for the privacy problem. Using network models and real data, we show that the average degree of networks is a crucial parameter for the severity of re-identification risk from nodes\u2019 neighborhoods \u2026"

      "abstract": "Temporal networks are essential for modeling and understanding systems whose behavior varies in time, from social interactions to biological systems. Often, however, real-world data are prohibitively expensive to collect or unshareable due to privacy concerns. A promising solution is `surrogate networks', synthetic graphs with the properties of real-world networks. Until now, the generation of realistic surrogate temporal networks has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of capturing both the temporal and topological properties of the input network, as well as their correlations, in a scalable model. Here, we propose a novel and simple method for generating surrogate temporal networks. By decomposing graphs into temporal neighborhoods surrounding each node, we can generate new networks using neighborhoods as building blocks. Our model vastly outperforms current methods across multiple examples of temporal networks in terms of both topological and dynamical similarity. We further show that beyond generating realistic interaction patterns, our method is able to capture intrinsic temporal periodicity of temporal networks, all with an execution time lower than competing methods by multiple orders of magnitude."

Using network science methods to analyze the underlying patterns of citations between cases can help us understand the large-scale mechanisms which shape the judicial system. Here, we use the case-to-case citation structure of the Court of Justice of the European Union to examine this question. Using a link-prediction model, we show that over time the complex network of citations evolves in a way which improves our ability to predict new citations. Investigating the factors which enable prediction over time, we find that the content of the case documents plays a decreasing role, whereas both the predictive power and significance of the citation network structure itself show a consistent increase over time. Finally, our analysis enables us to validate \u2026"

Using the Bass model, we quantify the prevalence of the rich-get-richer phenomenon. We find that the Bass model provides an excellent description of how individual decisions accumulate citations. Our analysis reveals that citations to a large fraction of decisions are, in fact, explained by the rich-get-richer phenomenon. Based on our statistical model, we argue that network properties are insufficient to explain the rich-get-richer effect, suggesting that intrinsic properties of decisions drive a significant part of the observed citation patterns. We conclude by discussing the legal implications of our findings."

      "abstract": "While individual tweets are interesting primarily to friends or fans of those tweeting, collectively they add up to something much greater. Analogous to neurons firing in synchrony as part of the orchestration of cognition, billions of tweets may constitute meaningful macrostates containing information about the system as a whole, not only about individual tweeters. This map conveys the mood of over 300 million public tweets sent in the United States between September 2006 and August 2009. The overall number of tweets is represented by a density-preserving cartogram, while the actual land area of states is sized by the number of tweets in that region. The mood of each tweet was inferred using ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words), a list of words rated for their emotional valence. Each state was then color-coded by its mood per hour, and averaged over the full period of three years. To witness the national mood rise and fall before your very eyes, view the time-lapse video of Pulse of the Nation at http://www. ces. neu. edu/home/amislove twittermood."

      "abstract": "The global public sphere has changed dramatically over the past decades: a significant part of public discourse now takes place on algorithmically driven platforms owned by a handful of private companies. Despite its growing importance, there is scant large-scale academic research on the long-term evolution of user behaviour on these platforms, because the data are often proprietary to the platforms. Here, we evaluate the individual behaviour of 600,000 Twitter users between 2012 and 2019 and find empirical evidence for an acceleration of the way Twitter is used on an individual level. This manifests itself in the fact that cohorts of Twitter users behave differently depending on when they joined the platform. Behaviour within a cohort is relatively consistent over time and characterised by strong internal interactions, but over time behaviour from cohort to cohort shifts towards increased activity. Specifically, we measure this in terms of more tweets per user over time, denser interactions with others via retweets, and shorter content horizons, expressed as an individual's decaying autocorrelation of topics over time. Our observations are explained by a growing proportion of active users who not only tweet more actively but also elicit more retweets. These behaviours suggest a collective contribution to an increased flow of information through each cohort's news feed -- an increase that potentially depletes available collective attention over time. Our findings complement recent, empirical work on social acceleration, which has been largely agnostic about individual user activity."

To this end, we here present a methodology based on dose\u2013response functions and hypothesis testing using surrogate data models that randomise most aspects of the empirical data while conserving certain structures relevant to contagion, group or homophily dynamics.

Although natural settings have been shown to restore the capacity to inhibit distracting stimuli, it remains unknown whether smartphone attention capture disrupts nature contact.

The relationship between greenspace exposure and smartphone activity differed by exposure dose, type, and mobility state.

However, it is widely believed that communication networks accurately capture the underlying collaboration amongst the members of an organisation. Here, through the use of multilayer and temporal network analysis methods, we analyse collaboration (through the project activity log) and communication (via emails) in a large engineering project and find that, on the contrary, collaboration and communication networks are only weakly correlated.

      "abstract": "The full range of activity in a temporal network is captured in its edge activity data -- time series encoding the tie strengths or on-off dynamics of each edge in the network. However, in many practical applications, edge-level data are unavailable, and the network analyses must rely instead on node activity data which aggregates the edge-activity data and thus is less informative. This raises the question: Is it possible to use the static network to recover the richer edge activities from the node activities? Here we show that recovery is possible, often with a surprising degree of accuracy given how much information is lost, and that the recovered data are useful for subsequent network analysis tasks. Recovery is more difficult when network density increases, either topologically or dynamically, but exploiting dynamical and topological sparsity enables effective solutions to the recovery problem. We formally characterize the difficulty of the recovery problem both theoretically and empirically, proving the conditions under which recovery errors can be bounded and showing that, even when these conditions are not met, good quality solutions can still be derived. Effective recovery carries both promise and peril, as it enables deeper scientific study of complex systems but in the context of social systems also raises privacy concerns when social information can be aggregated across multiple data sources."

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, machine learning has revolutionized computers' ability to analyze text through flexible computational models. Due to their structural similarity to written language, transformer-based architectures have also shown promise as tools to make sense of a range of multi-variate sequences from protein-structures, music, electronic health records to weather-forecasts. We can also represent human lives in a way that shares this structural similarity to language. From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People are born, visit the pediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get married, and so on. Here, we exploit this similarity to adapt innovations from natural language processing to examine the evolution and predictability of human lives based on detailed event sequences. We do this by drawing on arguably the most comprehensive registry data in existence, available for an entire nation of more than six million individuals across decades. Our data include information about life-events related to health, education, occupation, income, address, and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution. We create embeddings of life-events in a single vector space showing that this embedding space is robust and highly structured. Our models allow us to predict diverse outcomes ranging from early mortality to personality nuances, outperforming state-of-the-art models by a wide margin. Using methods for interpreting deep learning models, we probe the algorithm to understand the factors that enable our predictions. Our framework allows researchers to identify new potential mechanisms that impact life outcomes \u2026"

Nevertheless, we still lack a good understanding of how these structures emerge from individual behaviour. Here we present a general model for the emergence of social structures, which is based on a key aspect of real social systems observed across species, namely social preferences for traits (individual characteristics such as age, sex, etc.). We first show that the model can generate diverse artificial social structures, and consider its potential for being combined with real network data. We then use the model to gain fundamental insights into how two main categories of social preferences (similarity and popularity) affect social structure and function. The results show that the types of social preference, in combination with the types of trait they are used with, can have important consequences for the spread of information and disease, and the robustness of social structures against fragmentation. The results also suggest that symmetric degree distributions could be expected to be common in social networks. More generally, the study implies that trait-based social preferences can have consequences for social systems that go far beyond their effect on direct benefits from social partners. We discuss the implications of the results for social evolution."

Here we present a general model for the emergence of social structures, which is based on a key aspect of real social systems observed across species, namely social preferences for traits (individual characteristics such as age, sex, etc.). We first show that the model can generate diverse artificial social structures, and consider its potential for being combined with real network data. We then use the model to gain fundamental insights into how two main categories of social preferences (similarity and popularity) affect social structure and function. The results show that the types of social preference, in combination with the \u2026"

      "abstract": "Word embeddings provide an unsupervised way to understand differences in word usage between discursive communities. A number of recent papers have focused on identifying words that are used differently by two or more communities. But word embeddings are complex, high-dimensional spaces and a focus on identifying differences only captures a fraction of their richness. Here, we take a step towards leveraging the richness of the full embedding space, by using word embeddings to map out how words are used differently. Specifically, we describe the construction of dialectograms, an unsupervised way to visually explore the characteristic ways in which each community use a focal word. Based on these dialectograms, we provide a new measure of the degree to which words are used differently that overcomes the tendency for existing measures to pick out low frequent or polysemous words. We apply our methods to explore the discourses of two US political subreddits and show how our methods identify stark affective polarisation of politicians and political entities, differences in the assessment of proper political action as well as disagreement about whether certain issues require political intervention at all."

      "abstract": "Implementing a lockdown for disease mitigation is a balancing act: Non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce disease transmission significantly, but interventions also have considerable societal costs. Therefore, decision-makers need near real-time information to calibrate the level of restrictions. We fielded daily surveys in Denmark during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor public response to the announced lockdown. A key question asked respondents to state their number of close contacts within the past 24 hours. Here, we establish a link between survey data, mobility data, and, hospitalizations via epidemic modeling. Using Bayesian analysis, we then evaluate the usefulness of survey responses as a tool to monitor the effects of lockdown and then compare the predictive performance to that of mobility data. We find that, unlike mobility, self-reported contacts track the immediate behavioral response after the lockdown's announcement, weeks before the lockdown's national implementation. The survey data agree with the inferred effective reproduction number and their addition to the model results in greater improvement of predictive performance than mobility data. A detailed analysis of contact types indicates that disease transmission is driven by friends and strangers, whereas contacts to colleagues and family members (outside the household) only played a minor role despite Christmas holidays. Our work shows that an announcement of non-pharmaceutical interventions can lead to immediate behavioral responses, weeks before the actual implementation. Specifically, we find that self-reported contacts capture this \u2026"

Underslept individuals typically sleep more during travel than when at home, while individuals who average more than 7.5 hours of sleep at home typically sleep less when travelling. The difference in travel sleep quantity depends linearly on home sleep quantity and decreases as median sleep duration increases. On average, travel wake time advances to later hours on weekdays but earlier hours on weekends.

We phrase our problem of predicting future encounters as a link-prediction problem and utilise set of Random Forest predictors for the prediction task. We use data collected by the Copenhagen network study; a study unique in scope and scale and tracks 847 students via mobile phones over the course of a whole academic year.

In experimental studies, it is for example well-known that the framing of an experiment or priming at the beginning of an experiment can alter participants' behaviour. However, few studies have been conducted to determine why framing or priming specific words can alter people's behaviour. Here, we show that the behaviour of participants in a game-theoretical experiment is driven mainly by social norms, and that participants' adherence to different social norms is influenced by the exposure to economic terminology. To explore how these terminology-driven changes impact behavior at the system level, we use established frameworks for modeling collective cooperative behaviour. We find that economic terminology induces a behavioural difference which is larger than that caused by financial incentives in the magnitude usually employed in experiments \u2026"

We show that using information from pervasive Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices can enhance GPS and geographic information to improve transportation detection on smartphones. Wi-Fi information also improves the identification of transportation mode and helps conserve battery since it is already collected by most mobile phones. Our approach uses a machine learning approach to determine the mode from pre-prepocessed data. This approach yields an overall accuracy of 89% and average F1 score of 83% for inferring the three grouped modes of self-powered, car-based, and public transportation. When broken out by individual modes, Wi-Fi features improve detection accuracy of bus trips, train travel, and driving compared to GPS features alone and can substitute for GIS features without decreasing performance. Our results suggest that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be useful in urban transportation research, for example by improving mobile travel surveys and urban sensing applications."

We propose an interactive time spiral visualization technique for visualizing time series data aiming to capture the continuous property of QS data, while also emphasizing the reoccurrences of events on multiple time scales. The time spiral concept builds on top of a clock-dial metaphor with a circle corresponding to a arbitrary time span (eg hour, day, week). The continuity of the time series data is captured by the continuous spiral timeline with the present in the outer ring and the past towards the center. The time spiral visualization supports the user in exploring repetitive patterns, but also to observe deviations, irregularities, and changes over time. Possible configurations of the time spiral visualization is shown below.CASE STUDIES: DATA AND \u2026"

Vi analyserer p\u00e5lideligheden og pr\u00e6cisionen af forskellige metoder, der typisk benyttes til at rangordne lister af videnskabelige publikationer. Vi p\u00e5viser, at flere almindeligt anvendte kvalitetsm\u00e5ls manglende p\u00e5lidelighed g\u00f8r dem ubrugelige i praksis.Det er alment accepteret, at antallet af en videnskabelig artikels citationer\u2013set i forhold til andre artikler i samme felt\u2013udg\u00f8r et kvantitativt m\u00e5l for artiklens videnskabelige v\u00e6rdi. Hvis en artikel citeres ofte, betyder det, at artiklens indhold er en aktiv del af mange andres videnskabelige arbejde. Sammenh\u00e6ngen mellem citationer og forskeres videnskabelige v\u00e6rd er imidlertid mere kompliceret, idet de fleste forskere producerer mere end kun en artikel. Sp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5let om, hvordan citationerne af en r\u00e6kke artikler i en s\u00e5dan citationsliste kombineres til et m\u00e5l for personens videnskabelige form\u00e5en, er ikke trivielt, og det er emnet for denne unders\u00f8gelse. Vores analyse er baseret p\u00e5 alle artikler, der er publiceret i teoretisk h\u00f8jenergifysik og samlet i databasen SPIRES, men vi forventer kvalitativt lignende resultater for andre natur-og sundhedsvidenskabelige felter, hvor publikation af videnskabelige artikler spiller en central rolle i formidlingen af forskningsresultater.

      "citation": "",
      "author": "M Schich and S Lehmann",
      "abstract": "Recently a number of projects classify and annotate massive numbers of images and image segments with tags and other classifcation criteria. The work in these projects is either done manually by human editors (Russell, 2008: http://labelme. csail. mit. edu/; Schich, 2007; more examples see Obrenovic, 2007), automatically with the help of pattern recognition algorithms (see for eg http://www. definiens. com) or most promising by human computation, ie in a collaborative effort in the form of games such as Peekaboom (Ahn, 2006: http://www. peekaboom. org/).The data produced by these efforts can be understood as a bi-partite network with image documents in one partition and (visual) classification criteria in the other. Typically in addition, the image documents as well as the classification criteria in each partition may feature more structure in the form of trees or ontologies. Fig. 1 shows a simple example of this structure, where a painting and its classified segments (a) can be represented as a simple tree (b), which is connected to the partition of classifications via the classification link."

      "citation": "",
      "author": "Nikolaos Nakis and Abdulkadir CELIKKANAT and Sune Lehmann and Morten M\u00f8rup",
      "abstract": "Graph representation learning has become important in order to understand and predict intrinsic structures in complex networks. A variety of embedding methods has in recent years been developed including the Latent Distance Modeling (LDM) approach. A major challenge is scaling network embedding approaches to very large networks and a drawback of LDM is the computational cost invoked evaluating the full likelihood having O(N^2) complexity, making such analysis of large networks infeasible. We propose a novel multiscale hierarchical estimate of the full likelihood of LDMs providing high details where the likelihood approximation is most important while scaling in complexity at O(NlogN). The approach relies on a clustering procedure approximating the Euclidean norm of every node pair according to the multiscale hierarchical structure imposed. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approximation and for the first time embed very large networks in the order of a million nodes using LDM and contrast the predictive performance to prominent scalable graph embedding approaches. We find that our approach significantly outperforms these existing scalable approaches in the ability to perform link prediction, node clustering, and classification utilizing a surprisingly low embedding dimensionality of two to three dimensions whereas the extracted hierarchical structure facilitates network visualization and interpretation. The developed scalable hierarchical embedding approach enables accurate low dimensional representations of very large networks providing detailed visualizations that can further our understanding of their properties and \u2026"

      "author": "Ulf Aslak Jensen and Sune Lehmann and Enys Mones",
      "abstract": "Visualization of community structure in temporal networks is a relatively unexplored area of research. Efforts to understand these structures and build visualizations, have been made, but are mainly focused either on understanding dynamics through time series summary statistics, such as how the number of nodes/links or clustering coefficient develop over time [10, 11], or making simple animations where the viewer can control the time variable [8].In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a novel design for interactive visualization of community dynamics in temporal networks. Our demonstration uses a temporal network of real-world human interactions throughout a day, recorded as pairwise bluetooth connections between personal mobile phones held by students at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Communities are computed using the Infomap algorithm [1], and as a result, the demonstration shows \u2026"
